Welcome to the eighth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

I'm still focusing on creating an **MVP** for the **FizzBuzz Pro**
microservice and thus there's a lot of code, yet not as many articles.

## What's New on **Zero to Hero** 👩‍🍳

I've been working on several microservices, including the following:

* **Mailer**: To send system messages
* **Store**: To integrate with Stripe
* **IDM**: To manage users, authentication, authorization
* **Questions**: The service to serve... well... questions, answers, and related
  notes.

...and maybe a bunch of other services. The services are **Go**-based, and it's
amusing to develop. I'll share the code with you once the code is in a "*shareable*" 
state 😃.

## I'm Live Streaming the Development Process

## Radio Zero to Hero

This is something experimental that I'm trying. I'm not even sure it's against
Twitch's rules and guidelines, but as far as my research is concerned, it's
totally fair game:

While I'm not live screencasting my development environment, I'm streaming *
*awesome beats** on the channel.

hacking... [Tune in to Radio Zero to Hero on Twitch][twitch].

## Random Thought of the Week

If you are on social media, you have probably seen taglines like "*ex-(insert
company name here)*". While there's nothing wrong with associating with one's
old company, does that define the person?

Does labeling yourself "*Ex-Infinidashian*" just to hold onto the sense of
worth, or just to associate with being "accepted" defines your true self?---Same
goes for the top-tier college that you've graduated from.

So what's my advice, you may ask?

My advice is nothing that you haven't heard of before:

**Build your own brand**.

Instead of attaching your identity to something that's not you, build a brand
around you. Define your true self.

* Be **authentic**.
* **Communicate** your own beliefs and truths.
* **Add value** to the community towards your actions and deeds.

Don't rely on the reputation of something external to define who you are. Be
self-aware: [You are more than that][issue-0003].

[issue-0003]: @/highlights/issue-0003.md

Think about what you uniquely, **unequivocally**, contribute to the world.

Tangential to that is the *stigma* that comes with rejection: Being rejected
by (pick your top company or college of your choice) can suck. Yet, neither
rejection nor acceptance defines you: **You** define you---If they don't get
you, it's their loss, not yours.

Trust me, by investing in yourself through personal and professional
development, you can achieve so much than any big fat brand can "*ever*" offer
you.

**Trust** in yourself. **Define** yourself.

> **Who** are you?
