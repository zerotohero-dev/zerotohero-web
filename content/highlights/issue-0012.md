Welcome to the twelfth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

The last two weeks were full of articles, screencasts, videos, and
infrastructure development. Let's have an overview.

## Kuberneters Gonna Kubernete

There's [a 13-minute video about the journey of a microservice: from
source code to full-blown deployment][k8s-microservice] that I'm sure you'll
like.

[k8s-microservice]: @/zero-to-prod/deploying-a-microservice-to-k8s.md

## What's on the Horizon üë©‚Äçüç≥

Right now, I'm working on the **IDM** APIs of **FizzBuzz Pro**: Your typical
login, registration, signup flow.

Once they are done, I'll create a **Stripe integration** to enable
subscriptions.

As always, [I'll be live-streaming the progress on **Twitch** as much as
I can][twitch], so [**follow me on Twitch**][twitch] to get notified as soon as
I start working on real-life production challenges.

## Random Thought of the Week

Everyone has a list of things that they want to get better at. But the problem
with those lists are, they won't complete themselves. You have to find the
**focus** and **discipline** to work on them. It all boils down to forming and
establishing habits.

The good news is, you can establish a habit of regularly moving towards your
goal by taking a step-by-step approach. Here's how:

Start with the future result that you'd like to achieve. Then **articulate**
*why* that is important to you. Knowing your purpose helps you keep your
motivation high.

Next, define the measure of success. What does **progress** mean in this
context?
What does achieving your goal looks like? How will you know if you are making
progress at all?

After that, **ground yourself**; make a commitment, sign a pact with yourself
in however way you like---Some people want to print their vision and display it
on their wall; some use sticky notes and daily calendar reminders. It is all up
to you: Have a mechanism to constantly **remind** you why you do what you do.
Make yourself **aware** of your **intention**, your **commitment**, and your
**desired future** regularly.

Ah, one final thing. **Celebrate your wins**, no matter how small they are.
Any progress is worth celebrating.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [**PathFinder** is a nice app to visualize path-finding algorithms][pathfinder].
* [**Viewer.js** is **JavaScript** image viewer with a hell lot of 
  functionality baked in][viewer].
* [**Pure.css** is a robust, minimalist CSS framework that hit 2.0 
  recently][pure].

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
