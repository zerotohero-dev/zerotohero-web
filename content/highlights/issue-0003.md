## Lots of New Things Cooking in the Kitchen 👩‍🍳,

Welcome to the third issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week has been a total rush with many articles and content and some
functional and visual updates.

Ah, I've [updated the about page too](@/about/_index.md). The
page describes what **Zero to Hero** is and where it is heading towards. You can
also
find [a video of me talking about it](https://vimeo.com/v0lkan/zero-to-hero).

There is a new [**Tutorials**](@/_index.md) section where I'll write and talk 
about actual production projects that real people use. It will **not** be a 
sandbox "*restaurant rating React app*" or a yet "'nother" *to-do list*" clone. 
I'll develop and talk about **real**, **living **, **evolving** **production 
apps** [in the **use cases** section](@/_index.md).

These **use cases** will be as real as it gets. We'll together learn how to
design, deploy, develop, secure, scale up, and maintain the application for
real-life use. It'll be so much fun! I'm really excited about this.

> Additionally, I will take my notes to create separate articles and videos
> about any tool, technology, and foundational knowledge that I use in those 
> **use cases**. I will provide enough learning material to deep dive for the
> interested.

## Random Thought of the Week

Along with the rapid development of technology, it's getting harder and harder
to do everything by yourself. You inevitably find yourself having to work with
each other to establish a shared vision.

By that token, even when you are an individual contributor, you'll find yourself
having to **convince**, **persuade**, **guide**, and **coach** others.

That also means that regardless of tenure, expertise, or title, everyone has to
act as a leader in some way, shape, or form to succeed in today's multi-faceted
work culture.

To be a good leader, you'd need to **know how you lead**; and to understand how
you lead, you'd need to **self-reflect**.

It might sound coming from the mouth of [the oracle of 
Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) (*and [it
actually is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself)*) and a bit
wishy-washy, but knowing how you lead starts with **knowing yourself**.

So how do you know yourself? Well, that's obviously personal, but there are
certain key areas that you can focus on and there are specific questions that
you might want to seek answers to.

You can group those areas under five main categories.

* Self-awareness
* Self-regulation
* Self-motivation
* Empathy
* Influence

Of course, there are **many** more, but focusing on these five and improving
your emotional maturity on these five tangents will help you the most.

Let's look at these topics with a larger lens.

### Self-awareness

**Self-awareness** is knowing your strengths, weaknesses, desires, and values.
It is also knowing how you are influenced by others and how you influence
others.

When you are self-aware, you are confident, you can realistically (*and often
brutally*) self-assess your behaviors. You have an insatiable thirst for
constructive criticism.

### Self-regulation

Related to *self-awareness*, **self-regulation** is controlling disruptive
impulsive and moods that may prevent you from actualizing your potential.

When you self-regulate, you observe and understand how you feel, but you don't
let that feeling define your behavior. You maintain your **integrity** and *
*trustworthiness** no matter how dire the circumstances are.

When you learn yourself, and by extension, learn how to **regulate** yourself,
you'll be comfortable with ambiguity and change.

### Self-motivation

Self-motivation is how it sounds: It's a passion for achievement for the sake of
achievement. You don't do your best for money, fame, visibility, promotion, or
anything else. You do your best, and you are at your best because you simply
cannot think of any other way.

When you are self-motivated, you have an infinite passion and energy for
improvement. You'll maintain your optimism in the face of failure.

### Empathy

You can write books about **empathy**, and it's a skill that's the toughest to
master. And like any skill, you can master it when you constantly observe,
modify, and change your behavioral patterns.

**Empathy** is, at its core, is understanding people's emotional setups.

That will help you become a better leader who can understand and develop others.
You will become more **perceptive** to people's identities and understand the
nuances in cross-cultural differences in how people act.

**Empathy** (*not charisma, not power, not anything else but empathy*) is the
force that attracts and retains people around you.

### Influence

Again, you can write books about how to **influence** people, how to negotiate,
how to convince. Yet, at its very core, you can define **influence** as building
enough impact around you to move people towards a shared vision that you desire.

When you learn how you influence, you'll be better and effective in **leading
change**. You'll be more persuasive; you'll be amazed at how extensive your
network has become. You'll see that you are building and leading teams
naturally.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you 👌. Enjoy.

* [**Simplenetes**](https://github.com/simplenetes-io/simplenetes) is a simple
  and opinionated alternative to Kubernetes, especially useful for small (_<20
  nodes_) clusters. The project is still in beta, yet it looks promising.
* [**Velero**](https://velero.io/) is an open-source tool to safely back up and
  restore, perform disaster recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources
  and persistent volumes.
* In [**Making Strides Toward Serverless
  **](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/making-strides-toward-serverless-eb959d75d029),
  Matt is writing about the "_serverless_" deployment model, the _integration
  points_ to your **serverless** architecture, **serverless** functions, and
  various patterns for serverless adoption.

## Thanks a Lot ❤️

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you 🦄.
