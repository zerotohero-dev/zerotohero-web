Welcome to the fifth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week was full of new videos and articles. It was a productive week overall.

Let's jump right in.

## What's New on **Zero to Hero** üë©‚Äçüç≥

Here is a list of articles that I've published this week:

* In [The Repositories, Tools, and Services We'll Use for FizzBuzz 
  Pro][fizzbuzz-pro] use case, we looked into the repositories and services that
  we will use in **FizzBuzz Pro**.
* In [A Technique to Ensure Environment Variables Are Set Before Starting a 
  Microservice][microservices] article, we saw a technique to ensure that our 
  microservice does not start if any of the environment variables it depends on 
  is missing.
* In [Make Your Code Leaner By Extracting Methods][lean] article, we saw an 
  example of the **method extraction** refactoring technique.
* In [Let's Create a Syslog Logger][syslog]
  use case, we created a **logging wrapper** module that logs messages to 
  **Syslog**: a standard network-based logging protocol that works on a wide 
  variety of different types of devices and applications.

## Random Thought of the Week

I'll keep this week's random thought short and sweet: **be kind**---it's more
important than you think it is.

Not only **be kind** but also **model kindness on your team** too.

But how do you do that? I mean, how do you promote generosity and kindness in
your team? Let's see.

First, start with yourself: **Take the lead**. Give compliments to your
teammates.

Sometimes, people are blunt and up-front. Yet, that does not mean they have bad
intentions or ulterior motives. They likely want the team's success as much as
anyone else. Be available, helpful, and present for them.

> Teams are cauldrons of bubbling emotions, and decisions are made by carefully
> considering everyone's feelings---along with other things.

**Never assume malice**. People can have different ways to communicate. People
come from different cultural norms, and backgrounds. Reaching consensus is
complicated with two people already; it gets more complex as the number
increases. Don't make it even harder.

Kindness is contagious: Small gestures can have a big impact.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [**AWS Budget Limiter** is Terraform script for capping monthly AWS 
  spend][aws-limiter].
* [**GitUI** provides the comfort of a Git UI right in your terminal][git-ui].

  Crashing?**][crash].
