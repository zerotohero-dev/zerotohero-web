Welcome to the fourth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

I've done **a lot** of stuff this week, some of which you can find as new
articles on [Zero to Hero](https://www.zerotoherro.dev/), and some are still
brewing and cooking in **Zero to Hero Kitchens** that will reach you in time.

## Hello from the **Zero to Hero** Kitchens 👩‍🍳

Firstly, I've started creating a lot of video content; here's a quick preview of
what's in the immediate production pipeline. The range varies from setting up a
development environment to exporting DynamoDB tables... **a lot** of quality
material is coming your way.

![List of video content in the pipeline.](/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-03-at-7.30.56-PM.png)

The items that have green indicators next to them are the videos that have
already been published. The blue row is the one that I'm currently working on.

There's a lot coming down the pipeline---for example, in the **Setting Up a
Development Environment** video series, I start with brand new default Mac OS
system. There, I step-by-step install and configure my **opinionated** sets of
development tooling, environment, and applications.

## FizzBuzz Pro

**FizzBuzz Pro** is a sister project cooking in the *
*Zero to Hero** kitchens, and I think it deserves its own section.

> **FizzBuzz Pro** will be an app to provide you with algorithmic puzzles and
> **tried and tested** solutions to those puzzles, along with outlining
> **strategies** that you can reuse, and highlighting common **patterns** that 
> you can exploit.

It's no secret that companies are asking **competitive programming questions**
in technical interviews. That's the current **norm**, rather than the exception.

While I still don't understand the efficacy of asking algorithmic puzzles in
choosing the best candidate (*here's a [short 3min
video](https://vimeo.com/557079474/7810c8a850) and a [longer 30min "uncut"
version of it](https://vimeo.com/556452479/94cdf5a8f1) that I'm ranting about
the subject matter, in case you are interested*), apparently the rest of the
industry does not think like me. From startups to big corporations, everyone is
drinking the same kool-aid.

Even worse, these algorithmic puzzles do not measure your aptitude as a software
engineer, they do not measure your technical acumen. They are **robotic**
---inhuman, even. They are merely benchmarks about how fast you can come up with
a solution almost mechanically.

> If you cannot change the game rules, then you'll have to play the game by the
> rules. But, how?

Mastering competitive programming is **not** easy. Even if you have learned *
*data structures** and **algorithms** fundamentals in your college years, you'll
soon realize that **competitive programming** requires a **much** different
mindset; a **unique** way of thinking and approaching problems.

But, there's a bright side to it: Although it's **flocking hard work** to study
these questions---to the point that you'd rather want to have a root canal
instead of balancing yet another binary tree, every single day---you can still
be pro at competitive programming.

**FizzBuzz Pro** will help you to get better with the
game---Well, not right now, but when it's launched---we are working hard on it.

> **FizzBuzz Pro** is a greenfield project, and as I continue developing and
> productizing it, I will be sharing the entire process with y'all.

I will keep you posted about **FizzBuzz Pro**'s entire development process.

Right now, there's only an ascii-art placeholder on the website, but things will
change real fast real soon.

The thing is, you don't have to be an algorithm wizard; you don't have to be a
data structures genius to nail a technical interview. You just need to *
*practice** and **see** the **patterns** and **similarities** between various
kinds of questions.

![Practice (~via https://tapas.io/episode/923459)](/images/2021/06/practice.jpg)

In **FizzBuzz Pro**, I can, and I will help you with
seeing the common patterns and similarities between various questions. I'll help
you realize ways and techniques to approach them; and I'll provide you with
enough tooling to nail any algorithmic problem that'll be thrown at you.

Yes, "**patterns**"... that's something that I can help.

**Practice**... however, is something to do on your own. You'll have to allocate
**focused** and **uninterrupted** block of two hours **every day** (*weekends
included*).

> The only way to flex your competitive programming brain muscles is through *
*practice**. I'm sorry, and **there are no shortcuts**.

## Random Though of the Week

Have you ever doubted yourself? Like, have you ever had that nagging thought
that you may fail this time, or you are undeserving your achievements?

Well, you are not alone. And you can **constructively** channel those thoughts
and feelings to be more productive.

For example, instead of pushing back and shying away from experiences that make
you uncomfortable, embrace them. See them as opportunities to learn. Who cares
if you fail; you learned a lot, and you now know where to grow: There's always
room for growth.

This might sound harsh, and it's okay not to be the most intelligent person in
the room. Have the courage to ask about what you don't know. That
will---ironically---make you a more confident person. And your confidence will
transform you into a person that everyone goes for advice.

Finally, cherish feedback. Yes, it's sometimes hard to digest feedback from
people that you are doing something wrong or not showing the desired
behavior---who are them after all?---well, they are the people who care about
you; they want to see you improve, and they wholeheartedly believe that you can.

Never assume malice. Cherish the feedback, thank the feedback giver, and **take
your time** to reflect on and plan out how you can be an even better version of
yourself based on all that feedback.

## Recently on **Zero to Hero**

Here's [a quick video about installing **Go
** on Mac OS](@/vadideki-geyik/geyik-academy/go101/installing-go-on-mac-os.md), 
which is follow up to [Setting Up Your Go Development 
Environment](@/vadideki-geyik/geyik-academy/go101/go-setup.md)
article.

Other than that, most of the work we did was under the hood.

More content is on its way and it'll be ready for your reading and viewing
pleasure in the upcoming weeks.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you 👌. Enjoy.

Let's do a **Kubernetes** roundup this time:

* [Žilvinas Urbonas writes about AWS EKS vs. ECS vs. Fargate: Where to manage your Kubernetes](https://cast.ai/blog/aws-eks-vs-ecs-vs-fargate-where-to-manage-your-kubernetes/)
* [Samarth Deyagond on understanding the .kubeconfig](https://medium.com/the-phi/understanding-the-kubeconfig-3ef43e8716d)
* [`kcli` is a m anagement tool for libvirt/aws/gcp/kubevirt/openstack/ovirt/vsphere/packet](https://github.com/karmab/kcli)

Thanks a Lot ❤️

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you 🦄.
