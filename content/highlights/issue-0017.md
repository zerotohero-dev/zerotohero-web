Welcome to the 17th issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

It's been a while since my last newsletter, but I'm excited to get back into a
regular cadence of sending updates. I know, I know... that's what I said last 
time, too yet starting with this one, I am planning to be more consistent.

I hope the new year has started amazingly for you. To be fair, the year started
really amazing for me. Here are some of the highlights:

## A Trip to Hawaii üéÖ

But the highlight of the year was our trip to Hawaii. It was a week with
near-zero technology and full of nature. It was utterly recharging.

The beautiful landscapes and friendly locals made for a truly remarkable
experience. 

## Keep Your Secrets Secret With Aegis

I am excited to have released [Aegis][aegis] this weekend.

  alt="Aegis: keep your secrets"
)}}

[**Aegis**][aegis] is an open source **Secrets Store** that
provides secrets to workloads securely at runtime without requiring a pod
restart.

Essential features that make **Aegis** unique are:

* Kubernetes-first design
* Minimal footprint
* Hassle-free deployment
* And overall, a **delightful** user experience.

With **Aegis**, you can rest assured that your sensitive data is always **secure
** and **protected**. [Check out **Aegis** on GitHub][vsecm-github] for details.

With a caveat that **Aegis** is still a work in progress. I am improving its
feature set; however, it is still technically an alpha product. Therefore, any
part of it can change at any time. **Use it at your own risk**.

But while there, [if you share your stars on GitHub][vsecm-github],
I'd be delighted ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Mastodon Anyone?

[I also put together a guide][mastodon] for those looking to create and manage 
their Mastodon instances.

I [have been a part of Hachyderm Mastodon instance][hachyderm]
for a couple of months so far, and I can confidently say that it's a breeze of
fresh air after all the birdsite madness. I am **never** going back to Twitter!

I also have created my own single-user Mastodon instance z2h
(*edit 2024-05-21: z2h is not operational as of May 2024*), where I share many 
helpful for those interested. So if you like these newslettes, I'm sure you'll
appreciate *the z2h.dev Mastodon instance* too.

## Random Thought of the Week

I have wondered why the adage "*follow your passion*" does not always work 
and why it has this uncanny, misleading nature.

We've all heard the saying "*follow your passion*" when finding a career that
we'll love. But the truth is, it can be challenging.

If I focused on what came naturally to us and what we enjoyed doing, I'm pretty
sure I would be playing the Elders Scrolls of Morrowind forever.

It is more productive to consider doing the activities that challenge us: The
activities that are even mildly annoying. If you know that when you endure the
struggle, there is a positive reward, that's the kind of activity that's worth
pursuing.

You might be better at these things. But you'll always be energized by tackling
them head-on and putting in the hard work.

So, aside from having fun, it is also essential to have **the right kind of fun
** for a good purpose.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [A little known fact about the **Internet Archive** is, you can totally 
  search it for scholarly articles][archive].
* [**Box CLI Maker** creates boxes for your CLI apps][box].
* [So you want a tool to build internal tools really fast. Say no more fam, 
  and meet **ReTool**][retool].

Thanks a Lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all for this week. Next week, I'll gather more unique content and
resources.

So, until next time... May the source be with you ü¶Ñ.
