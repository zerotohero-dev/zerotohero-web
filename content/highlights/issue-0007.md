Welcome to the seventh issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

This week, I was busy refactoring a tiered enterprise **Java Spring** project.
It consumed more time that I anticipated. Can I say I'm a **JavaSpring**
developer now 😀 (*instead of "JavaScript"---get it, get it?*)---okay, lousy dad
pun. But still, I had to shift my schedule to adapt to tackling with that beast,
which consumed **a lot** of my time and energy.

**The good part**: I learned a heck lot of [**_Spring Cloud_**][spring-cloud]
and [**_Spring Security_**][spring-security] internals, 
more than I'd like to know, actually. My verdict is: Although Java has moved a 
long way since *J2EE*, and with the [**Spring Framework**][spring]**,
**it's on the right path; yet I still do think it is **heavy** and **verbose**.

> [**The Spring Framework**][spring] is still worth learning **_if_** 
> you want to shoot flies using rocket launchers 😜---kidding, or **maybe not**.
> Anyhoo, [try it yourself][spring] and tell me how your learning
> experience went.

## What's New on **Zero to Hero** 👩‍🍳

This week, I mainly did infrastructure and plumbing work, such as creating
container images and ensuring that **FizzBuzz Pro** microservices are at least
answering to *health* and *liveness* endpoints.

Other than the live streams, there's not much visible progress, but many cool
things are brewing behind-the-scenes---stay tuned.

## Random Thought of the Week

Do you keep a journal? If not, you should.

Your journal also helps to start your day with a set of probing questions. Here
are the five questions I ask myself **every single day** and how those questions
change and shape my life:

{{img(

  alt="The questions I ask to myself every single day."
)}}

### What is it that you really want to be and do?

This question is about your **aspiration** and **purpose**. What is it that you
do, and what is it that you **really** want to be great at doing. The key is to
**be honest** with yourself. The question does not read "*what do people want
you to become?*", it asks what is it that **YOU** want to be and do.

### What are you doing really well that is helping you get there?

This question helps you spotlight a core strength and your ability to execute
towards your goal.

### What are you not doing well that is preventing you from getting there?

This, again, requires an honest and critical assessment of the things that block
your way.

### What will you do differently tomorrow to meet those challenges?

> Don't practice your forehand while your backhand sucks.

This question pushes you to focus on the right priorities so that you don't get
into a situation of "*I am making good time, but I am lost.*" It also helps move
you out of your comfort zone.

### How can I help myself / where do I need the most help?

The answers to the first four questions match against areas where you (*as your
own mentor*) can have particular strengths. In contrast, the second question
helps you to open up to your network to **ask for help**.

## Keep on Journaling

I journal a lot, initially with pen and paper and later on digitally. I believe
it's a **transformative** experience that everyone needs to give it an honest
try at least.

> Your journal is a regular private, personal, **honest**, and **truthful**
> self-diagnosis that can take **at most two minutes** of your time.  
> If you don't have two minutes a day to spare, well, then you do need to sort
> out your priorities.

Besides, journaling is not a big hurdle: You are not writing a novel or an
essay---unless you want to. You can use anything to journal: Pen and paper works
just fine; you can use a dedicated app, or you can fire your favorite text
editor. It doesn't matter.

Keeping a journal clears your mind off of random thoughts, helps you keep on
track and achieve your goals and clarifies your intentions.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you 👌. Enjoy.

* [Run any code on any client with **WebAssembly** and **Wasmer**][wasmer].
