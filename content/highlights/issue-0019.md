![Attention, Intention: Compassion](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/comms.png)

Welcome to the nineteenth issue of **Zero to Hero** Highlights.

It's a new year and a new issue. I'm still recovering from the long break, and
ideas are a bit fragmented in my mind. So I'll leave them that way and jot down
whatever comes to mind. It's the first issue of the year after all 🙂.

## Zero to Prod in Half an Hour

I started the year with a video lecture series
about [how you can deploy a production-ready web application 
in half an hour](@/zero-to-prod/_index.md).

> I have ~15 lectures. I've published two of them already. And I'm planning to
> publish 2-3 lessons every week depending on my workload.

## FizzBuzz Pro

While, on the topic of **FizzBuzz Pro**, there is a lot planned for **FizzBuzz
Pro**

In the next few weeks, I want to focus on the infrastructure. Then, once the web
app has a minimally-viable feature set, I'll circle back to adding more
competitive programming questions and learning resources there.

Stay tuned.

## GopherCon Was Awesome 🎉

## Random Thought of the Week

Here are some random thoughts. I don't have a theme; I'm writing as it comes to
mind. Yet, I'm sure you'll find something useful out of them.

Here we go...

### Equating Innovation to Throughput

There's a misperception that innovative teams are quick decision-makers. That's
not always true: Sometimes the best ideas require long incubation periods.

Sometimes resisting the temptation to "*move fast*" can lead to more
far-reaching and creative solutions.

### Have an Open Mind

Creative thinking is a mentally taxing process. As a leader, you should pay
close attention to how new ideas are shared and discussed between your
teammates.

Encourage people to build upon each other's ideas instead of flat-out
criticizing them. Approach ideas with an open mind; acknowledge what's practical
and improve what appears weak.

### Give People Space to Think Alone

While group brainstorming feels more productive because of the social
amplification factor, it's not always the best way to come up with ideas.

If the problem is complex, you may want to let people think about it for
five-ten minutes before discussing the idea. Then you can ideate independently
without being sidetracked by others' thoughts can be helpful. After five minutes
of self-ideation, you can go on group brainstorming as usual.

Try it, and you'll feel the difference.

### Listen Intently

While it might sound like a cliché, there is one golden rule in communication: "
**_Treat others the way you want to be treated_**."---actively listen to people
around you. If you can hear them with an open mind and willingness to learn, not
only you'll become wiser, but you'll also become better equipped to help them.

Whenever you are about to talk to someone in the team, step back a moment. Ask
yourself: What might be going on with them? Would they need any kind of support
other than the technical project you are working with? Leadership requires
compassion.

Motivate people to become a better version of themselves:

When you see that someone is doing good enough, you might feel that pushing them
to learn more or to do more can be discouraging. Instead, reframe that thought
as an indication that you care about them and want them to be better. When you
think that way, challenging people to grow (*within reason*) is consequentially
an act of kindness.
