Welcome to the 23rd issue of**Zero to Hero Highlights**. A lot has happened 
since the last issue. Let's check them out, shall we?

## It's the Wonderful Time of the Year

It's the holiday season when time stops, and you start relaxing and going with
the flow. I hope you spend time with your family and loved ones, enjoying and
cherishing every moment 🎅.

I am sure the new year will be fantastic. I plan to kick some epic ass in the
next year 🙂; I bet you'll do the same too.

## Same Content, New Name

You might have realized that I've changed this newsletter's name because calling
it "*Zero to Hero Weekly*" does not make sense when I publish once a month---if
I'm lucky, that is 😆.

So **Zero to Hero Highlights** is the new name.

Given the dynamic nature of my schedule, the intervals between my updates have
been more extended than a week, which reflects the multitude of ongoing projects
and commitments. However, the newsletter's content will remain similar, as I'll
follow a similar theme.

## Got My Mac Burger

As a Thanksgiving (*and a post-acquisition---see below*) present,[**I got a
beefy Mac Studio**][mac-burger].

{{img(
  src="/images/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-10.52.44-PM.png"
  alt="This thing is a monster!"
)}}

I can achieve a lot with **24 CPUs and 128 gigabytes of RAM**; I can do a lot 
with this beast of a machine. For example, it enables me to simulcast to multiple
platforms without requiring a separate streaming machine.

## Volkan Uses

[I created a website containing a list of tools, gadgets, 
software, and hardware][volkan-uses] that I currently use, have used, 
liked, and find worth mentioning.

## Deer in the Valley

> **Update 2024-05-27**
> 
> We paused **TalkSPIFFE** for a while. We might resume it in the future.
> SPIFFE already has its official community snyc-ups, and duplicating the
> effort didn't make sense. We might revisit the idea in the future, but for now,
> it's on hold.

Along with[**TalkSPIFFE**][talkspiffe] and [**VMware Secrets Manager Contributor 
Hours**][vsecm-sync], I've also started hosting a new tech podcast,
[**Deer in the Valley (*Vadideki Geyik*)**][vadideki-geyik].

*By this writing,**Deer in the Valley**is among Turkey's**top 10**in
the **Technology**category and**top 16**in Azerbaijan in the same category
again. We are having**so much fun**while recording the sessions, also reflected
in these stats.*

With[**four folks from the Silly Cone Valley**](https://vadidekigeyik.com/team), 
we started a podcast about our experiences before and after working there and our 
thoughts, ideas, and tips for those who want to follow a similar career path. 
It's very well-received by the community.

One caveat, though: The show is in**Turkish**. So, if you don't know Turkish,
either use a simultaneous translation AI or maybe it's time to learn a new
language to expand your horizons---and get lost in translation a little.

**I see the entire thing as therapy**. We talk freely and candidly about the
good, bad, and ugly of the Tech Valley, our lives, and everything in between.

We do live talks on the[**Kampus Discord**][kampus] and simulcast it over 
[**Twitch**][twitch] and [**YouTube**][geyik-youtube]. We typically livestream 
the session **every other Saturday at 10 am Pacific time**.

## Radio Geyik 🦌 📻

> **Update 2024-05-21**:
> 
> This experiment didn't work out as expected, and I've shut down the radio
> station. I might revisit the idea in the future. 
> 
> The YouTube channel still continues to simultcast streams, though.
 
We simultcast the *Deer in the Valley* live shows on
[**ZeroToHero Twitch**][twitch], [**Kampus Discord**][kampus], and
[**Deer in the Valley YouTube**][geyik-youtube].

In addition to all of the above, I'm experimenting with something new. Whenever
the channel is idle, I stream otherworldly beats there. So, if you want
something to listen to while getting stuff done,[**head down to the Dear in the
Valley YouTube channel**][geyik-youtube].

## `npm install deers`

We also have an NPM package called[**deers**][deers],
which is a helper to provide random deer ASCII art images.

It's a fun little project; [**check it out**][deers].

Contributions are---as always---welcome.

## Hey, What Is This "*Kampus*" Thing Anyway

[**Kampus is a Discord community**][kampus] where anyone interested in learning 
about tech can join. The closest way to visualize it is to imagine an actual 
College Campus with lectures, student clubs, co-working sessions, libraries, 
etc.

> **So, Is Kampus Like a Study Group? Or...**
>
> We intentionally keep the definition of "*Kampus*" vague so that it will
> evolve and define itself.
>
> I see Kampus as a community of like-minded individuals who want to grow and
> become a better version of themselves.

## Hello Broadcom

[**Broadcom has acquired VMware**][broadcom-news] after dragging for around 
one and a half years.

That has been one and a half years of waiting in relative stress and anxiety.
So, I'm**glad**that the deal has been sealed. This means I will be working at a
new company, doing the same thing: doing epic innovations around Radio Access
Networks, leveraging[**O-RAN**][o-ran].

This was a**$69B**acquisition, one of the largest (*if not "the" largest*) of
its kind. So, it will take some time for things to settle down. As things settle
down, I'm sure I'll have more to share in the next highlight. But overall, it's
pretty darn good news, and I'm confident things will be epic!

## Wait, How About VSecM?

One immediate question I've received from various channels is whether this
merger will impact[**VMware Secrets Manager**][vsecm] in any way. As
far as I can tell, there are no immediate changes in the project's status and
governance. We'll continue to secure the cloud-native world one secret at a
time. The[**VMware Secrets Manager**][vsecm] will remain open-source 
[under VMware's GitHub organization][vsecm-github].

That said, things are new. I will inform everyone in various channels, including
VSecM Slack workspace, Twitter, and other communities if I receive any specific
guidance related to**VMware Secrets Manager**. However, I don't expect any
significant changes. From the vantage point of VSecM, things will continue to
be "_business as usual_."

[vsecm-github]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager

## VMware Secrets Manager Is Growing

On that topic, [**VSecM has a team of core maintainers right 
now**][vsecm-maintainers]. And we are getting external contributions, too. 
To contribute to the project, contact me or[**any of the core 
contributors**][vsecm-maintainers], and we'll do our best to help you hit 
the ground running.

To learn more about VSecM,[**check out its website**][vsecm].

## Federating Secrets Across Clusters

For the**VMware Secrets Manager**enthusiasts who have been following the
project's development for a while, I've experimented with cross-cluster
federated secrets sharing using**VSecM**, which went well.

[**I also created a quick demo**][vsecm-demo]
and [**talked about it in SIG SPIRE**][vsecm-sig-spire].

In addition, I am working on a tutorial to show step-by-step how to establish
cross-cluster secrets federation; I'll share it in various channels when it's
done.

## Moved VMware Secrets Manager's Build Server to Linode

Another**VSecM**news is since I don't need anything specific to AWS for VSecM's
build needs, I moved it to[**Linode**][linode]: fanatical support
and excellent price/performance ratio. I am delighted with them so far.

Besides, you can get almost twice the performance from Linode with the same
amount of money you shell out to AWS. And their tech support is top-notch; they
have never let me down.

## VMware Secrets Manager Onboarding Session

Within the context of[**Kampus**][kampus], I've also delivered a 3-hour 
onboarding session for[**VMware Secrets Manager**][vsecm] to a group of 
interested developers who want to contribute but don't know where to start.

The training was very well received.

* I gave a presentation about what**VSecM**is, what a**Secrets Manager**is, and
  why we need such a thing,
* Followed by a code walk and architectural overview,
* Finally, doing a live demo to show how**VSecM**works in practice,
* Then, there was a**Q&A**session to wrap things up.

It was great, and the project received many contributions after the onboarding
session. Which motivates me to do more of the same.

Next, I plan to do a follow-up session about setting up a**VSecM**development
environment.

I record these training sessions and share them[**exclusively with the Kampus
members**][kampus]. So, to watch the videos, you'll need to[**join 
Kampus**][kampus].

## Zero to Hero Live Streams are Back

Another piece of news is that I've started streaming on the[**Zero to Hero
Twitch channel**][twitch] more frequently.

Whenever I work on something unrelated to my work at VMware that I can share
with you folks,[**I stream it**][twitch].

As mentioned, I also simultcast the stream on[**Deer in the Valley (Vadideki
Geyik) YouTube Channel**][youtube] and the[**Ada Lovelace Stage on the 
Kampus Discord Server**][kampus].

## OpsBeacon Has Shown Much Progress

Another project that has shown much progress is [**OpsBeacon**][ob2].

Although I don't directly contribute to the code, I'm one of its advisors, so I
constantly communicate with the team, exchanging ideas and discussing
architecture. And they have done a tremendous job in the last couple of months.

I have used**OpsBeacon**in my workflows and automation, and I can honestly say
that it's incredible. It's a tool that you don't know how much you need
OpsBeacon badly until you use it. And after you begin using it, you are hooked.

## Random Thought of the Week

Nurturing your curiosity can impact your leadership skills, learning abilities,
and value as a team member. Here are four supported methods to cultivate your
curiosity.

### Take Ownership

Don't wait for factors like being too busy or relying on your mentors or
superiors to drive your growth. Recognize that fostering curiosity is solely
your responsibility. Commit to regularly allocate time to explore topics that
intrigue you.

### Identify Your Interests

Reflect on the subjects you're genuinely eager to learn more about or the areas
you aspire to master. Dedicate 20-30 minutes each day pursuing these interests
through reading, writing, or engaging in discussions with like-minded
individuals.

### Break Your Routines

Never underestimate the power of shaking up your routines. By changing how and
when you perform tasks, exploring routes to work, trying out lunch spots, or
engaging in diverse weekend activities, you can significantly expand your
mindset and invite fresh ideas into your life.

### Embrace Novelty

Be open-minded and willing to try things even if they don't initially align with
your interests or experiences. Embrace the thrill of discovering hobbies,
indulging in "pleasures," and embracing diversity in all aspects of life.

These strategies will help foster curiosity within you. Enhance your growth as a
leader, learner, and valued team member.

Feel free to change direction and give something a shot if it doesn't connect
with you or pan out.

By following these guidelines, you can actively nurture your curiosity,
ultimately contributing to professional development.
