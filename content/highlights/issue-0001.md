## Hello World, Hello Stars, Hello Universe

Hi there,

Welcome to the very first **Zero to Hero** Highlights digest where I share my
thoughts about the week and give a brief overview fo what has happened in
"*Zero to Hero*", in the industry, and in the open-source ecosystem recently.

## About These Newsletters

I'm planning to send these newsletters to the **Zero to Hero** subscribers every
week---possibly on Friday so that you'll have some nice weekend bedtime reading
material üôÇ.

> This is the very first **Zero to Hero Weekly Digest**: The format of this
> newsletter will evolve and change in time---of course, your feedback is
> vastly appreciated.

## Random Thought of the Week

Here's a random thought: Have you ever got stuck while doing your work, and
needed help, but you were afraid to ask for help because you feared bothering
your teammates?

When I find myself in that kind of a situation, here's what I do:

Firstly, I double-check the question is worth asking: I **do my homework**,
search the web, read internal company wiki, read the source code and fiddle
with the problem for a while-if the thing is something that I can learn by
myself with minimal hassle, I just jump on it.

If I cannot effectively handle the issue myself, then the next thing I try to
find is a **path of least resistance**: Oftentimes finding the **best person**
to ask the question, **how** to ask it, and **when** to ask the question are
equally important (*if not "more" important*) than actually asking the question.

I additionally pay attention to the person's **communication style**: While some
people are all about Slack messages, some prefer email, and some would rather
do an ad-hoc chat around the water cooler.

Remember: **communication is what the listener does**.

In the end of the day my goal is to make the life of the person who's going to
help me as easier. In a sense, I'm helping them help me.

Also whenever possible, I provide as much **context** as I can. I show the
person the work I've done so far, and the pain points that I'm having. That also
shows that I value their time.

It might sound trivial, but having a place that I hold the information that I
gathered from this person is also important. I would not want to end up asking
the same questions over and over again after all.

So far these tricks served me well when asking for help. I hope you'll find them
useful too.

## Recently on **Zero to Hero**

Here's a selection from the recent **Zero to Hero** articles:

* [Every Saga Has a Beginning](@/about/a-new-hope.md): This is
  the initial article outlining how this all started. It's a bit personal,
  reflecting on myself, my life, and what my plans are for "*Zero to Hero*"s
  future.

## Look What I've Found

Here are the things that grabbed my attention this week.

I typically don't share these anywhere else.

Exclusively hand-picked for you üëå. Enjoy.

* [Trisha Gee: Code Review Best Practices - SCLConf 2018][trisha]:
  In this talk, Trisha will identify some best practices to follow. She'll talk
  about what's really important in a code review, and set out some guidelines to
  follow in order to maximize the value of the code review and minimize the
  pain.
* [Vulture: Find Dead Python Code][vulture]:
  Vulture finds unused code in Python programs. This is useful for cleaning up
  and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your
  library and test suite you can find untested code.
* [Mentee Missteps][mentee]:
  Given the importance of the mentor-mentee relationship, it is imperative that
  mentees put their "*best foot forward*". The article outlines what kind of 
  "*behavior smells*" mentees might manifest that can make the mentor-mentee
  relationship unsustainable.
