In VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), adding cloud capacity is accomplished through a process called host commissioning, where physical servers are added to the SDDC Manager inventory. This guide walks through the process and key considerations.

## Understanding Host Commissioning

Host commissioning creates a "free pool" of available capacity from added servers. This pool serves as the foundation for:
- Creating new workload domains
- Expanding existing clusters
- Managing overall cloud capacity

## Network Pool Configuration

### Default Configuration
- Management pool created during initial bringup
- Serves as the baseline for management domain

### Creating New Network Pools
Network pools can support multiple network types:
- vSAN
- vMotion
- iSCSI
- NFS

### Network Pool Setup Process
1. Navigate to Network Settings
2. Click "Create Network Pool"
3. Specify:
    - Pool name
    - Network types to support
    - VLAN details
    - MTU settings
    - IP subnet information
    - IP address ranges for SDDC manager

## Host Commissioning Process

### Prerequisites Checklist
Before commissioning hosts, verify:
- ESXi installation completed
- vSphere standard switch configured
- Pre-existing disk partitions removed
- DNS configuration completed
- Network connectivity established

### Adding Hosts

Two methods are available:

#### Individual Host Addition
Requires:
- Fully qualified hostname
- Principal storage type
- Network pool assignment
- Root user credentials

#### Bulk Host Import
For multiple hosts:
- Uses JSON file format
- Includes same information as individual addition
- More efficient for large-scale deployments

### JSON File Structure
The import file must include:
- Host details
- Storage configuration
- Network assignments
- Credentials
- Additional configuration parameters

## Validation Process

After adding hosts:
1. SDDC Manager connects to each host
2. Verifies prerequisites
3. Checks connectivity
4. Validates configurations
5. Reports success or failure

## Commissioning Workflow

### Steps
1. Initial validation
2. Host preparation
3. Network configuration
4. Storage setup
5. Final verification

### Monitoring
- View workflow progress in SDDC Manager
- Monitor subtasks
- Access error details if needed
- Track completion status

## Best Practices

1. **Pre-commissioning**:
    - Verify all prerequisites
    - Prepare network pools
    - Document host information
    - Test connectivity

2. **During Commissioning**:
    - Monitor workflow progress
    - Address any validation errors
    - Keep credentials secure
    - Document any issues

3. **Post-commissioning**:
    - Verify host availability
    - Check network configurations
    - Test connectivity
    - Update documentation

## Conclusion

Host commissioning is a critical process in expanding VCF capacity. By following these steps and best practices, administrators can ensure successful host addition and maintain a healthy cloud infrastructure. Remember to always verify prerequisites and monitor the commissioning process to ensure successful deployment.

The ability to commission hosts both individually and in bulk provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios, while the comprehensive validation process helps ensure reliability and consistency in your VCF environment.
