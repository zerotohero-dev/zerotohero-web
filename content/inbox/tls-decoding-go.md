When working with TLS certificates in Go applications, you might encounter some unexpected challenges. In this post, we'll explore a common issue that occurs when dealing with base64-encoded certificates and how to resolve it.

## The Problem

Consider a scenario where you're building a secure web server in Go that needs to use TLS certificates. You're retrieving these certificates from a secrets management system, but when you try to start the server, you get this cryptic error:

```
Error loading server certificate and key: tls: failed to find any PEM data in certificate input
```

This error occurs because the certificates are being provided in base64-encoded format, but Go's TLS configuration expects them in PEM format. Let's look at how to fix this.

## The Initial Code

Here's what the problematic code might look like:

```go
cert, err := tls.X509KeyPair([]byte(serverCert), []byte(serverKey))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Error loading server certificate and key: %v", err)
}

tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
    Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
}
```

This code assumes the certificate and key are in PEM format, but what if they're base64-encoded? Let's look at how to modify this to handle base64-encoded certificates.

## The Solution

The solution involves adding a decoding step before creating the X509 key pair. Here's the complete code with the fix:

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/tls"
    "encoding/base64"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // ... (certificate fetching code)

    // Decode base64 encoded certificate and key
    decodedCert, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(serverCert)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error decoding server certificate: %v", err)
    }

    decodedKey, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(serverKey)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error decoding server key: %v", err)
    }

    // Configure TLS with decoded certificate and key
    cert, err := tls.X509KeyPair(decodedCert, decodedKey)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error loading server certificate and key: %v", err)
    }

    tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
        Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
    }

    // Set up the HTTP server
    server := &http.Server{
        Addr:      ":8443",
        TLSConfig: tlsConfig,
    }

    fmt.Println("Server is running on :8443 with TLS enabled")
    log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServeTLS("", ""))
}
```

## Understanding the Fix

The key changes in this solution are:

1. **Import the base64 package**: We need to add `encoding/base64` to our imports to handle the decoding.

2. **Decode the certificates**: Before creating the X509 key pair, we decode both the certificate and key:
   ```go
   decodedCert, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(serverCert)
   decodedKey, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(serverKey)
   ```

3. **Use decoded data**: We use the decoded data to create the X509 key pair instead of the raw base64-encoded strings.

## How to Identify Base64-Encoded Certificates

Base64-encoded certificates typically have these characteristics:
- They contain only alphanumeric characters, plus '+', '/' and '='
- They don't have the familiar "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" and "END CERTIFICATE" markers
- They're usually one long string without line breaks

In contrast, PEM-formatted certificates look like this:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDQTCCAimgAwIBAgIUOL6XR5PRHNs...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

## Best Practices

When working with TLS certificates in Go:

1. **Always validate certificate format**: Check whether your certificates are base64-encoded or PEM-formatted before processing them.

2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Include proper error handling for both decoding and certificate loading steps.

3. **Log meaningful messages**: Include detailed error messages to make debugging easier.

4. **Consider automation**: Use tools or scripts to handle certificate format conversion if you frequently deal with different formats.

## Conclusion

Dealing with TLS certificates in Go can be tricky, especially when they're not in the expected format. By understanding that certificates might be base64-encoded and knowing how to handle them, you can avoid common pitfalls and build more robust applications.

Remember to always check the format of your certificates when debugging TLS-related issues. The error "failed to find any PEM data in certificate input" is often a good indicator that you're dealing with encoded certificates that need to be decoded first.

Happy coding!
