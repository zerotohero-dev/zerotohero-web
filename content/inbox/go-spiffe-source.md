When working with the go-spiffe library, one common question developers face is how to properly manage SPIFFE sources. Specifically, should you create a new source for each request, or can you maintain a long-living source? Let's dive into how source management works in go-spiffe and explore best practices for your applications.

## The Lifecycle of a SPIFFE Source

A SPIFFE source, created using `workloadapi.NewX509Source()`, is designed to be a long-living component in your application. When you create a source, several important things happen behind the scenes:

1. The source establishes a streaming connection to the Workload API
2. It automatically receives and caches X.509-SVID updates
3. It maintains the connection and handles credential rotation

## Best Practices for Source Management

Here's how you should typically set up a source in your application:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer cancel()

source, err := workloadapi.NewX509Source(ctx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer source.Close()

// Use the source throughout your application's lifetime
```

### Do's:
- Create the source once during application startup
- Reuse the same source throughout your application's lifetime
- Close the source when shutting down your application
- Handle errors appropriately during source creation

### Don'ts:
- Don't create and close sources for each request
- Avoid creating multiple unnecessary sources
- Don't ignore source cleanup on application shutdown

## Why Long-Living Sources Matter

The streaming connection maintained by the source ensures that your application always has valid credentials. The library handles all the complexity of:
- Certificate rotation
- Trust bundle updates
- Connection maintenance
- Automatic retry on failures

This means you don't need to worry about manually refreshing credentials or managing trust material updates. The library takes care of all of this for you.

## Common Pitfalls

One common mistake is creating a new source for each request. This is inefficient and can lead to:
- Unnecessary connection overhead
- Increased latency in your applications
- Higher resource utilization
- Potential rate limiting from the Workload API

## Conclusion

Understanding how to properly manage SPIFFE sources is crucial for building reliable applications with go-spiffe. By following these best practices, you can ensure your application handles identity and authentication efficiently and securely.

Remember: create your source once, use it throughout your application's lifetime, and let go-spiffe handle the complex task of managing your identity credentials.
