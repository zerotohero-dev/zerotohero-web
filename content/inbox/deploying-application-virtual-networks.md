Application Virtual Networks (AVNs) are software-defined networking constructs built on overlay-backed virtual networks within NSX. When deploying the VMware Aria suite in Cloud Foundation, understanding AVN configuration is crucial for proper implementation.

## Understanding AVN Types

When deploying AVNs for the Aria suite, two distinct network segments are created:

### 1. Region Segment (Local Virtual Network)
- Purpose: Hosts components that run locally
- Characteristics: No failover requirement
- Example components: Aria Operations for Logs
- Local-only operations

### 2. Cross-Region Segment
- Purpose: Hosts components requiring DR capabilities
- Supports failover to DR site during outages
- Hosts components such as:
    - Aria Suite Lifecycle Manager
    - Workspace ONE Access
    - Aria Automation
    - Aria Operations

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
- NSX edge cluster must be deployed in the management domain
- Tier-1 router must be available

### Configuration Steps

1. **Initial Navigation**
    - Access SDDC Manager
    - Navigate to AVNs tab
    - Select management domain
    - Choose Actions > Add AVNs

2. **Network Type Selection**
    - Choose between:
        - Overlay-backed NSX segments
        - VLAN-backed NSX segments
    - Note: DR capabilities require overlay-backed segments

3. **Edge Configuration**
    - Select NSX edge cluster
    - Choose associated Tier-1 router
    - Configure segment attachment

### Segment Configuration

#### Region Network Settings
- Name specification (e.g., "region")
- Subnet configuration (e.g., 192.168.11.0)
- Gateway assignment (e.g., 192.168.11.1)
- MTU setting (typically 8940)

#### Cross-Region Network Settings
- Name specification (e.g., "x-region")
- Subnet configuration (e.g., 192.168.31.0)
- Gateway assignment (e.g., 192.168.31.1)
- MTU setting (typically 8940)

## Deployment Verification

### NSX Manager
- Check network topology
- Verify segment creation
- Confirm routing configuration

### vSphere Client
- View segments as port groups
- Verify distributed switch integration
- Check network availability

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Design Planning**
    - Determine component placement
    - Plan IP addressing scheme
    - Consider DR requirements

2. **Network Architecture**
    - Review existing network topology
    - Plan segment integration
    - Consider bandwidth requirements

3. **Security Considerations**
    - Segment isolation
    - Access controls
    - Traffic patterns

## Benefits

1. **Software-Defined Networking**
    - Flexible network configuration
    - Automated deployment
    - Consistent implementation

2. **Disaster Recovery**
    - Built-in failover capability
    - Site resilience
    - Component protection

3. **Integration**
    - Seamless NSX integration
    - vSphere compatibility
    - Automated management

## Conclusion

Deploying AVNs through SDDC Manager provides a streamlined approach to creating the necessary network infrastructure for the Aria suite. The automated process ensures consistent configuration while supporting both local operations and disaster recovery requirements.

The separation between region and cross-region segments allows for flexible component placement while maintaining appropriate failover capabilities where needed. This architecture supports both operational efficiency and business continuity requirements.
