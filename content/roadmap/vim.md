## Introduction

[`vim`](https://www.vim.org/) is a highly configurable text editor built to make
creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as `vi`
with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. `vim` is famous for having a steep
learning curve. But if you ask me, learning vim is not much different than
learning touch typing. It all boils down to repetition, practice, and muscle
memory.

You don't have to learn vim to be a developer; however, learning how to use vim
well will certainly make you a more productive developer. Besides, if you are a
developer, sooner or later, you'll have to use `vim` in your career at least at
a bare minimum level. So the earlier you begin learning it, the better.

## How Do I Learn `vim`?

Here are a few resources that can help you speed up your `vim` learning:

* [Vim genius](http://www.vimgenius.com/)
* [Open Vim](https://www.openvim.com/)
* [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13607232-practical-vim) 
  (*this one is one of the best books I've read about `vim`; and it, indeed, 
  is practical*)
* [Learning `vi` and `vim` Editors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2403747.Learning_the_vi_and_Vim_Editors)

However, the only way to learn `vim` is to **actively** use it. Luckily
enough, almost any code editor has a *vim emulation* mode or a *vim plugin* that
you can download and install.

> **Most IDEs Have a `vim` Emulation Mode**  
> When you learn `vim`, you can use the vim mode in your favorite IDE of your
> choice. Except for specific crazy macros, you could use it just like good
> old `vim`---it's not exactly the same thing, but for most practical purposes
> it'll be "close enough."

If you use the "*vim mode*" in your editor of choice, then using `vim` on the
terminal will be second-nature to you.

## Conclusion

When you master `vim`, you'll see that it will have a **positive** impact on
your development productivity.

Yes, `vim` is an editor that has one of the **steepest** learning curves; and
it's **worth** your time to learn it. There are even people who claim "[*vim 
learning curve is a myth*](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth)", so
maybe it is not that hard after all 😉.

I hope you find the resources here useful in you `vim` learning journey.

Until next time... May the source be with you 🦄.
