![Want to Learn JavaScript? Learn Haskell First](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/functinal.png)

## Srsly?

_I_'m serious about this.

Anyone who wants to master **JavaScript** had
better [learn Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) beforehand.

This article explains the "_why_"s and "_how_"s of it.

## Why Do I Need Haskell?

Modern **JavaScript** has become and more **functional**. Also, the modern *
*JavaScript** frameworks and libraries strongly encourage (_sometimes, to the
point of **enforcing**_) you
to [think functionally](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29627874-functional-thinking).

Moreover, most of the **functional** constructs that modern **JavaScript**
implements have been borrowed straight out of [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) 
or are easier to grok when you already know their [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) counterparts.

Not only vanilla **JavaScript**, but also many popular **JavaScript** tools and
frameworks such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), or
the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html),
or [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) are tools that are *
*highly inspired** by _functional_ languages like [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/).

Even [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
s are [Monadic constructs](https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads), and 
[**Monad**](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
is a data type that **Haskell** programs use extensively to modify state.

> 
> [Learning **Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) will change how you think:
> You'll look at programming problems from a **simplistic**, elegant, **pure**,
> and different perspective. That's what matters.

The reason many developers have a hard time understanding **JavaScript** is not
about the complexity of
it: [JavaScript is an easy-to-understand language](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/).
You can learn the basics of it in a couple of days to a few months tops.

The problem is not the rules, or semantics of the language: Learning to "_think
in JavaScript_" is what takes time, effort, and energy.

When you learn a [_purely functional
language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming), 
and [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) is the best "_pure_" functional language
out there, thinking in **JavaScript** will be a **cakewalk** for you.

## Where Do I Learn Haskell?

Here are a few links to help you learn Haskell:

* [C9: Programming in Haskell](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/Lecture-Series-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-1)
* [Introduction to Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Tutorials)
* [Learn Your Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)
* [Learning Haskell (_Haskell Wiki_)](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskel)
* [Real-World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
* [All About Monads](https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads)
* [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Pictures](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)

* [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)
* [Haskell Tutorials](https://wiki.haskell.org/Tutorials)

## **Bonus**: Read K&R's **C Programming Language**

Even if you don't professionally plan to write C, every developer should
read [K&R's C Programming Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/515601.The_C_Programming_Language)
---It teaches you a lot in so little; it's a classic.

> **Rant**

> A programmer who has not

> is like a geek who has not read Asimov. Don't be that person.

## Conclusion

After learning **Haskell**, I'd recommend you 
[give **Go** a go](https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-go/) too.

> [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS),

I hear some of you asking, "_What's the advantage of learning two other
languages, just to learn a third language?_".

If you ever watched [The Karate Kid](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/),
then you know the reason: Even if you have studied a couple of weeks of [*
*Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) and [**Go
**](https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-go/), you'll be "_miles ahead_" when you
begin your **JavaScript** journey.

Your mind will be _wired_ to think in **JavaScript** without you even realize.

There are countless articles, books, videos, and tutorials to cover your *
*JavaScript** bases. I'll write about it later. Yet a quick web search will
provide you with more resources than you need 🙂.

So off you go, learn some cool $#!%.

And until next time... May the source be with you 🦄.
