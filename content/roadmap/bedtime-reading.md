This is an extension to [**Be the Next Version of Yourself**][roadmap] I wrote 
a while ago. Here, you'll find mainly language and platform-agnostic
learning resources to help you become a better software craftsman.

I have roughly categorized the links in this document into sections, but they
are in no particular order.

All of those links below point to the books'
[**Goodreads**][goodreads] profile so that you can read what
others have to say about them and decide whether to read them yourself.
