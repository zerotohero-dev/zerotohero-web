![Psst... You Don't Have to Use Medium: Discover the Freedom of Owning Your Content](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/freedom.png)

## Wait... But Why?

Medium has risen in popularity among writers, bloggers, and readers due to its
user interface and community-centered features that have attracted a large
following.

Despite Medium's appeal and ubiquity, the paywall approach and the authority it
wields over content is worrisome at best. I cannot emphasize this enough: **You
must own your content as a creator**.

## Dear Medium, for once, have a spine---will you?

Medium's practice of blocking nonsubscribers from accessing content is
dishonest: While it puts a paywall around the content, it fully enables search
engines to index it.

Let me make it clear: Had Medium made its entire content subscriber-only without
intentionally leaking it to the search engines, I would have been one of the
first to subscribe and support it.

While it aims to monetize content and support writers financially, it also 
**creates obstacles to information accessibility**.

This paywall can discourage readers and restrict the audience to emerging or
specialized bloggers. Additionally, Medium's method of displaying paywalled
material on search engines but preventing access without a subscription is 
**deceptive**, leading to nothing but frustration among readers.

## The Predicament of Platform Authority

A major issue with Medium revolves around its control over users' content.

You are a **content creator**. You should not give a flying care about "the
algorithm."---Your writing shall not be influenced by the platform's evolving
rules and algorithms.

**Your content is yours**; own it.

> You are not and shall not be a puppet to make your content more engaging. Your
> voice should not be a slave to the algorithm. Don't lose yourself.

There's also the concern that Medium could change its business

## The Significance of Ownership and Control

Values like **ownership**, **transparency**, and **control** are important not
only in your work but also in how you share knowledge and ideas (_including
through blogging_).

Ownership of your content allows you to **choose** how it is displayed and
shared: If you want to monetize your content, it's on your own terms; if you
don't, no external party can enforce it.

That's why I'm sharing my thoughts on this blog, 
using [**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/) as a platform. If you don't prefer to 
use Ghost, there are many choices you can pick from. But please, pretty please, 
if you value your content, don't post it to a place you don't own.

## Why I Use Ghost?

As I mentioned, the kind of platform you choose is of little importance. Still,
this is a good point to segue into why I like **Ghost** as a blogging platform.

Ghost is a notable **open-source** blogging platform. I like its **speed** and 
**simplicity**. Although I don't care too much about SEO, it's good to know that
Ghost also offers robust SEO capabilities built-in.

As a Ghost user, I have full ownership of my content and the freedom to
personalize the site's appearance and functionality. I can use an existing
theme, purchase a theme, and tweak it, or, if I so want, build my own Ghost
theme with its unique functionality. Literally, the Sky is the limit there!

If I want, Ghost offers features like memberships and subscriptions built into
the platform, allowing me to monetize my content directly without anyone in the
middle.

In today's world, the ability to innovate, customize, and communicate freely is
not a choice but a **fundamental principle** that should be honored.

And, I don't even have to host Ghost. Because I value my time, I
use [Ghost's managed solution](https://ghost.org/pricing/). This eases the
responsibilities of server maintenance, updates, and security management. It's a
perfect option because I want to prioritize content creation to infrastructure
management.

Yet, despite the managed nature, I have full ownership. I can even streamline my
backups through Ghost API. I can back up my entire blog periodically to a
storage solution of my preference, which will give me further peace of mind.

## Conclusion

In this new world of AI-generated copycats, high-quality content reigns supreme,
and having the ability to manage and possess your own voice is more important
than ever.

While platforms such as Medium have made it easier for writers to reach
audiences they also come with restrictions that can hinder creativity and
restrict engagement with readers.

**Taking ownership of your content goes beyond independence**---it's about
safeguarding your heritage and ensuring that your voice remains genuine and
unfiltered.

**Self-publishing** is about crafting a space that truly mirrors your vision and
evolves alongside your audience free from the changing rules and priorities of
platforms.

Self-publishing is an investment in **building your brand** and **advancing
professionally**. It gives you the freedom to **experiment**, **innovate**, and
**customize** your content strategy to suit the needs and preferences of your
audience---a **priceless** experience.

With tools and platforms tailored for creators, the barriers to getting started
have never been lower. You don't have to use Ghost; use
something, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), 
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Next](https://nextjs.org/)...
Your options are countless. I'm sure you can find one that fits your unique
needs.

Owning your platform allows you to focus on what counts;
creating **valuable** and **meaningful** content.

**Own your content**.
