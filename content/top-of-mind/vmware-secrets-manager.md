![Long Live Aegis!](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/aegis.png)

Dear community,

I am thrilled to share an update with all of you. **Aegis** has transformed and
landed into its new home! It is now entering a phase as **VMware Secrets Manager
** for Cloud-Native workloads!

[Please learn more about our project in the repository 
following this link](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager).

Also, [stay updated with us on our website at **vsecm.com**](https://vsecm.com/).

## Coming Up Next

This change represents more than just a new name. It symbolizes our unwavering
dedication to pushing boundaries, fostering innovation, and delivering reliable
solutions for your cloud-native workloads.

As things settle down, we're already busy planning our steps. You can keep track
of our progress. 

[Follow our plans in our roadmap page](https://vsecm.com/docs/roadmap/).

We aim to provide how the project will proceed as transparently as possible. Of
course, our contribution cadence and frequency depend on the availability and
commitment of our core contributors.

## Stronger Together

While Aegis has served us well, **VMware Secrets Manager** under VMware Tanzu
GitHub organization opens up possibilities. It brings us closer to fulfilling
our promise of offering you an efficient, secure, and cutting-edge cloud-native
Secrets Management solution.

We are thrilled about this chapter and eagerly anticipate serving you, our
community, as we move forward. Your contributions and feedback mean the world to
us.
