This video series will guide you through establishing a secure cross-cluster *
*mTLS** connectivity between workloads across multiple clusters using **SPIRE**.

{{img(

  alt="SPIFFE, Turtles, and SPIRE"
)}}

We will start with a blank slate, create our apps from scratch, package them,
deploy them to our clusters, and then deploy and configure **SPIRE** to federate
our clusters to establish cross-cluster **mTLS** connectivity between workloads.

These video series assume that you have *some* level of familiarity with 
[**SPIFFE** and **SPIRE**][spiffe]. [If you are new to **SPIFFE** and 
**SPIRE**, check out this introductory article first][spire-rocks].

That said, let's get started with the first video in the series in the playlist
below.
