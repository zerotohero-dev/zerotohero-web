![FizzBuzz Pro High Level Design](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/blueprint.png)

In this quick video, we'll overview a high-level overview of **FizzBuzz Pro**
APIs.

Since **FizzBuzz Pro** is a work in progress, anything can change anytime;
however we have to start designing somewhere. So, without further ado, here
comes the video that explains the initial design:

FizzBuzz.Pro High-Level System Architecture

As I said in the video, I'll create additional content in the form of **articles
**, **source code**, and more **videos** as I continue implementing **FizzBuzz
Pro**.

It'll be an awesome learning journey. Stay tuned 🎵.
