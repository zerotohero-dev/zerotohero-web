In this quick video, we'll overview a high-level overview of **FizzBuzz Pro**
APIs.

Since **FizzBuzz Pro** is a work in progress, anything can change anytime;
however we have to start designing somewhere. So, without further ado, here
comes the video that explains the initial design:

  title="FizzBuzz Pro High Level Design"
)}}

As I said in the video, I'll create additional content in the form of **articles
**, **source code**, and more **videos** as I continue implementing **FizzBuzz
Pro**.

It'll be an awesome learning journey. Stay tuned ðŸŽµ.
