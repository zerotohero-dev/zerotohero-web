![About Me](/images/size/w1200/2024/03/deerz.webp)

Don't miss the deer, go kiss the deer 🦌💋.

## Hey There 👋

Hello, I'm **Volkan**.

I’m a **developer**, speaker, **streamer**, **creator**, connector,
and writer.

I like tinkering with systems, and I’m not afraid to **break stuff**.

## Broadcom

Currently, I'm a **Senior Principal Engineer** (*Master*) at 
[**Broadcom**](https://www.broadcom.com), reinventing Radio Access Networks as 
you know it.

## Zero Trust, SPIFFE, and SPIRE

I am very active in the Zero-Trust security space. And, related to that, 
I am a chair at the [**SPIFFE Steering Committee**][ssc], where I help
drive the strategic direction and growth of all projects under 
the [**SPIFFE**][spiffe] umbrella.

## O-RAN Security Focus Group

I also contribute to the discussions of [O-RAN][oran]
**Security Focus Group** (*WG-11*) helping secure the future of mobile 
communication one protocol at a time.

## Always Curious

As an engineer, I solve **problems**: The context, the origin, or the nature of 
the problems are **orthogonal** to the approaches I take in solving them.

I’m a big believer in **asking questions**.

It’s the **curiosity** that matters.

## Ideas Matter

**Since 2003**, I have been all over the stack, as far as stack goes:
I've created **mobile**, **web**, and **desktop** apps, played with 
**SQL/NoSQL/GraphQL** data stores, and more.

I’ve **automated** the deployment of **microservices**, played with serverless, 
**Kubernetes**, and **service meshes**. I’ve used real-time databases, 
**streams**, WebSockets, **protocol buffers**, lambda functions, and 
**message queues**. I’ve crafted solutions to improve the **scalability** and 
**performance** of distributed systems.

I’m pretty sure there’s much more to add to the list that I don’t remember 
right now.

Yet, that’s me in a nutshell: I’m a pragmatist nerd who gets _$#!%_ done.
