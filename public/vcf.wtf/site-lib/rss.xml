vSphere is the platform (the whole virtualization stack)
vCenter Server is the control plane that manages the coordinates of that platform
ESXi is the hypervisor that runs on hardware and executes VMs.
I mentally see (but don’t tell) this as “vSphere is just marketing”:
There is nothing I can curl called vSphere. it is “air”. <img alt="what-is-vmware-vcenter-vs-vsphere-vs-esxi.webp" src="assets/what-is-vmware-vcenter-vs-vsphere-vs-esxi.webp" target="_self">VMware vSphere is a product suite, not a single binary.To be clear: vSphere is a product name, or a platform name.

<br>A <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> is a logical grouping of ESXi hosts that vCenter treats as a single resource pool and failure domain.
It exists only in vCenter
ESXi hosts do not know they are “in a cluster”.
When you create a cluster in vCenter Server, you are telling:
“*These ESXi hosts agree to be scheduled, balanced, and failed over together.”This enables cluster-level logic, such as
DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler): vCenter decides which host should run which VM.

If a host dies: Other hosts detect it

In vSphere Supervisor a tenant is namespace-bound.
There is no separate tenant object inside Kubernetes.
<br>A <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> is the tenant boundary at the vSphere-Kubernetes interface.
If you assume:
Tenant = Project → you’ll design the wrong thing
Tenant = Kubernetes namespace → you’ll under-secure
Tenant = Supervisor Namespace → things line up
“tenant namespace” is an informal shorthand for supervisor namespace. Organizations and Projects are governance overlays. They do not define the tenant.Kubernetes namespaces inside guest clusters are secondary scopes.In vSphere Supervisor each tenant is realized as one (or more) Supervisor namespaces.
VCF Automation sits above, provides governance (Organizations, Projects, quotas) and self-service, but does not define tenancy by itself.This is sometimes “informally” expressed as “tenant namespaces”. What is meant by it is a Supervisor Namespace.Or more precisely: In a Supervisor Cluster tenant == supervisor namespace (there is a 1-1 relationship).<br>In vSphere Supervisor, tenancy is realized through <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s, which serve as the execution and isolation boundary for tenants.When people say:
“tenant namespace”
“project namespace”
“customer namespace”
They almost always mean: A Supervisor Namespace allocated to that tenant. Kubernetes does not have a separate construct for this: It is a vSphere concept, projected as a namespace.A Supervisor Namespace can contain:
Pods
VMs
Entire guest Kubernetes clusters
Tenant
└── Supervisor Namespace ├── VM workloads ├── Pod workloads └── Guest K8s Cluster └── many Kubernetes namespaces
VCF Environment
└── vSphere (vCenter) └── Supervisor Cluster └── Supervisor Namespace ← TENANT BOUNDARY
At this layer:
Supervisor Namespace Has: Resource limits Storage policies
Network segments
RBAC bindings Is created and owned by vCenter
Maps to: Resource pools
NSX constructs
Datastore permissions
This is where hard multitenancy lives. <br><img alt="supervisor-cluster.webp" src="assets/supervisor-cluster.webp" target="_self"><br><a href=".?query=tag:tenancy" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#tenancy">#tenancy</a> This is logical tenancy, not execution tenancy.Organization

VCF Environment (Rackspace)
└── Supervisor Cluster ├── ns-cocacola ← Tenant: Coca-Cola ├── ns-pepsi ← Tenant: Pepsi └── ns-pizzahut ← Tenant: Pizza Hut
Each tenant is a supervisor namespace.<br><img alt="Supervisor-Namespace.png" src="assets/supervisor-namespace.png" target="_self">For Coca-Cola (example):
Fixed CPU / memory quota
Dedicated or isolated NSX segment
Approved storage policies
RBAC scoped to Coca-Cola admins
Ability to run: Pods
VMs
Guest Kubernetes clusters
That namespace is the tenant boundary. Layer VCF automation on top of this:Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke-Prod └── Deployments → targets ns-cocacola Organization: Pepsi
└── Project: Pepsi-Shared └── Deployments → targets ns-pepsi
Organizations and Projects map to Supervisor Namespaces — they do not replace them.Automation gives:
Self-service catalogs
Approval workflows
Policy as code
Lifecycle orchestration But the tenant still “lives” at the Supervisor Namespace.Scope
vCenter
Supervisor Cluster
NSX
Storage policies
Responsibilities
Create Supervisor Namespaces
Set quotas
Attach networks
Bind tenant identities
Enforce platform guardrails
Power level
God-mode
Not visible to customers
Scope
One Supervisor Namespace (e.g., ns-cocacola)
Kubernetes API within that namespace
Responsibilities
Manage workloads
Deploy guest clusters
Configure service
Delegate access internally
Cannot
See other tenants
Modify quotas
Escape namespace
This is who you hand the kubeconfig to.
Scope
Kubernetes RBAC inside tenant (supervisor) namespace
Possibly inside guest clusters
Responsibilities
Deploy apps
Manage services
Consume secrets
No infrastructure privileges
Scope
Automation policies
Catalogs
Projects
Approvals
This role:
Often held by Rackspace
Sometimes delegated partially to tenants
<br><a href=".?query=tag:secrets" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#secrets">#secrets</a>
Secrets do not cross Supervisor Namespaces
Identity trust roots often terminate there
Network policy enforcement happens there
Audit logs are scoped there
So when you say tenant == Supervisor Namespace,
then:
Security
Compliance
Billing
Automation
all align clearly.

A unit of compute that consumes CPU, memory, storage, and networking, and is subject to lifecycle, policy, and governance.

How it is isolated
How it is scheduled
How it is governed

many disposable units forming a service.A pod workload is a Kubernetes Pod running on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster.A pod on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster is not a traditional Kubernetes pod.
It is a vSphere Pod — Kubernetes-shaped, but vSphere-implemented.Key point:
A pod workload is not a VM pretending to be a container. Supervisor pods are VMs implementing container semantics, not containers implemented as VMs. A Supervisor pod is a Kubernetes Pod whose execution unit is a micro-VM, where the VM boundary replaces the Linux container boundary. The VM is the isolation primitive
The Pod is the semantic primitive
The container image is payload, not a process model
So the VM is not “pretending to be a container” —
it is implementing the Pod abstraction using a VM instead of a process.
Pod (Kubernetes API object) └─ Backed by └─ Ultra-lightweight VM └─ ESXi └─ Hardware
It is:
A Kubernetes-native unit
Scheduled by Kubernetes
Governed by Kubernetes APIs
Backed by vSphere under the hood Kubernetes API (Supervisor cluster) is authoritative
vCenter supplies infrastructure, not lifecycle semantics
VCF Automation governs Kubernetes intent, not individual pods CPU / memory requested via Kubernetes requests &amp; limits
Scheduler decides placement
Isolation via: Namespaces
RBAC
Pod security

Reconciliation-based
Pods are ephemeral
Restart ≠ failure
Replacement is normal Namespace-level quotas
Admission control
Image policies
Network policies VM workloads → legacy, stateful, pet-like systems
Pod workloads → cloud-native, stateless, cattle-like systems
VCF’s value is:
Running both on the same physical infrastructure, with unified policy and automation, without forcing one model onto the other.
Trying to manage pods like VMs breaks Kubernetes.
Trying to manage VMs like pods breaks operational reality.VCF keeps them separate but coordinated.<br>A pod workload in VCF is a Kubernetes-native execution unit scheduled and governed by the <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> Kubernetes control plane, consuming vSphere resources indirectly through Kubernetes abstractions—unlike a VM workload, which is a hypervisor-managed, OS-bearing unit directly governed by vCenter.
“Pod workload” ≠ “small VM”
Pod workloads are Kubernetes-first, not vSphere-first
VMs are stateful machines
Pods are replaceable execution instances
VCF supports both because enterprises need both

The vSphere Supervisor is a Kubernetes control plane deployed as system-managed VMs on ESXi, whose lifecycle is owned entirely by vCenter Server and whose purpose is to expose Kubernetes semantics directly on vSphere infrastructure.
The vSphere Supervisor physically lives as vCenter-managed Kubernetes control-plane VMs running on ESXi hosts inside a vSphere cluster.

This configuration provides a resilient, HA-capable platform. Additional vSphere Zones can be added after initial enablement. However, these additional zones are available for workload consumption only, not for Supervisor control plane components. Single Host: Also a Single-Zone Supervisor with a single Control Plane VM deployed to a single ESX host, with vSphere HA disabled.

Connected to a guest clusterkubectl get ns
kubectl create ns foo

All of these will work as expected.
Supervisor namespaces → owns the cluster.
Guest cluster namespace → normal Kubernetes semantics.
# check Supervisor-specific APIs
kubectl api-resources | grep -i vm virtualmachines vmoperator.vmware.com # look at the nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide # look for VM Operator
kubectl get pods -A | grep vmoperator
Supervisor cluster nodes typically show:
ESXi-backed control-plane VMs.
Special node labels
VM Operator components
Guest clusters look like:
Standard linux nodes
kubelet-managed lifecycle
No VM Operator CRDs. In a Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are Kubernetes namespaces whose lifecycle, limits, and security are owned by vSphere.
In a guest cluster, namespaces are owned entirely by Kubernetes.

They are:
Resource-governed containers
Backed by: vSphere Networking (<a data-href="NSX" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/nsx/nsx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX</a>)
<br>vSphere Storage (<a data-href="VSAN" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsan/vsan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VSAN</a>)
vSphere RBAC From vSphere's perspective, a Pod, VM, or VM-based Pod is just scheduled compute.Supervisor namespaces intentionally mimic Kubernetes semantics:From the developer's laptop, they feel like ordinary Kubernetes namespaces.Here is where they differ though (mostly around ownership and LCM)in Supervisor namespaces, resource governance is outside Kubernetes.In Kubernetes:
CPU/memory limits = ResourceQuota
Storage = StorageClass + PVC
Network = CNI rules
In Supervisor:
CPU/memory = vSphere resource pools
Storage = datastore policies
Network = NSX segments
Limits are hard boundaries, not advisory
So when you say:
"This namespace gets 8 vCPU and 64 GB RAM"
That's not a Kubernetes promise---that's vSphere enforcing physics.Security model is in vSphere, not in KubernetesKubernetes RBAC applies inside the box vSphere already drew.That’s why certain Kubernetes admin actions are silently blocked even when RBAC says “allowed”.From Kubernetes’ POV:
It looks like a CNI plugin In reality:
NSX owns: L2/L3 segments
Firewall rules
Load balancers Kubernetes asks politely. NSX decides.This matters for:
NetworkPolicy
Ingress behavior
Multi-tenant isolation
In vanilla K8s:
PVC requests storage
Cluster tries to satisfy it
In Supervisor:
PVC must map to pre-approved storage policies
Datastore capabilities are enforced externally
StorageClass ≈ view of vSphere policy, not a free-form construct.The goal of this abstraction is to:
Let Kubernetes users feel at home
Let infrastructure teams retain determinism
Avoid “Kubernetes ate my datacenter” chaos
So Supervisor namespaces are:
Kubernetes-compatible interfaces to vSphere-owned sandboxes Supervisor namespaces intentionally impersonate Kubernetes namespaces
Kubernetes sees them as native; operations are externally enforced
vSphere owns: lifecycle
resource limits
security boundaries Kubernetes operates within those constraints

It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp; Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture. Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.
