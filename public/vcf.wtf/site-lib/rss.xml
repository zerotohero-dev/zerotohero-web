Are my applications getting the resources they expect, and if not—why?
Performance monitoring collects and analyzes application-level metrics from virtual machines and supporting infrastructure.
CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
Latency, throughput, and contention indicators
Performance baselines derived from historical behavior
Correlation between application performance and infrastructure conditions
This shifts the perspective from “is the host healthy?” to “is the application experiencing friction?”Advanced analytics and machine learning are applied to identify patterns and anomalies that traditional monitoring often misses.
Detects abnormal behavior relative to learned baselines
Correlates symptoms across compute, storage, and networking layers
Highlights probable root causes rather than isolated alerts
Enables faster time to resolution while avoiding unnecessary overprovisioning
The result is signal over noise, especially in large or dynamic environments.Performance monitoring ensures workloads maintain reliable access to required resources.
Identifies resource contention and saturation risks
Surfaces inefficient resource usage and imbalance
Supports proactive scaling and right-sizing decisions
Helps balance performance objectives against cost efficiency
This allows operators to protect performance without defaulting to over-allocation.A VCF Operations management pack is a modular integration that extends monitoring and analytics to specific infrastructure or platform components.
Collects metrics, events, and alerts from integrated systems
Normalizes telemetry into a common operational model
Enables deep, component-aware performance analysis
Supports consistent monitoring across heterogeneous environments
Management packs are what allow VCF Operations to scale from generic monitoring into domain-aware performance intelligence.Performance Monitoring is:
Application-aware and infrastructure-correlated
Predictive and analytics-driven
Focused on sustained performance and efficiency
Performance Monitoring is not:
Simple threshold-based alerting
A standalone APM tool
A workload deployment or governance mechanism Performance monitoring ensures applications continuously receive the resources they need
AI-driven analytics reduce noise and accelerate root-cause analysis
Management packs enable deep, system-specific insights at scale
The goal is sustained performance and cost discipline—not just uptime

It provides tenancy, subscription, entitlement, and usage visibility across organizations and projects.If vCenter answers “what is running?”, BSC answers:
“Who is entitled to what, who is using it, and how should it be charged?”

Resource Pools do not add resources — they only slice and prioritize what already exists in the cluster.
Think of a cluster as a water tank:
The tank size = physical host capacity
Resource Pools = valves
Shares = which valve opens wider under pressure
Reservations = minimum guaranteed flow
Limits = maximum allowed flow
No matter how many valves you add, the tank size never changes.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> itself does not require Resource Pools, but they are often used:
To separate platform workloads from tenant workloads
To protect management components from noisy neighbors
To enforce guardrails in shared clusters

Classic virtualization problem:
Infrastructure admins can ultimately see everything.
vTA introduces cryptographic separation of duties:
Infra admins manage hosts and clusters
They do NOT control keys
Decryption happens only after hardware attestation
This matters in:
Regulated environments
Confidential Computing
Insider-threat models
Sovereign cloud designs Trust Authority Cluster boots with TPM-backed identity
Hosts and workloads are attested
Only if attestation passes: Encryption keys are released
Protected workloads decrypt and run If trust breaks: Keys are withheld
Workloads remain encrypted / suspended Access to infrastructure ≠ access to data <br>Separate <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> cluster
Minimal admin surface
Hosts key and attestation services Uses CPU security features (e.g., SEV, TDX)
Prevents memory inspection Keys never live with workload admins
Often backed by HSMs
vTA is the strongest isolation boundary in vSphere.Typical usage:
Confidential VMs
Telco and Financial Workloads
Government / Sovereign Clouds
Typical non-usage:
General enterprise clusters
Cost-sensitive environments
Dev/Test
VTA is deliberately heavyweight.Think of vTA as:
“Even if someone owns the data center, they still cannot read the data.”
It is zero-trust applied to virtualization itself.
❌ Not a secrets manager
❌ Not an identity provider
❌ Not Kubernetes confidential computing (though complementary)
❌ Not required for VCF Strongest insider-threat protection
Hardware-rooted trust
Clear separation of duties Additional clusters and hardware
Operational complexity
Limited workload compatibility vSphere Trust Authority brings confidential computing to VCF
It cryptographically separates infra admins from data access
Optional, niche, but extremely powerful
Used when “root access is not enough” must be enforced

Business Continuity / DR
Compliance-aligned deployments
Each one narrows a broad platform into a specific, repeatable design.They are not:
Reference “ideas”
Whitepapers
One-off examples
Mandatory architectures You can deviate—but once you do, you own the risk.
For architects and platform owners, Validated Solutions provide:
Faster time to value
Reduced design ambiguity
Predictable upgrades
Clear escalation paths Less freedom
Opinionated choices
Slower adoption of bleeding-edge features
This trade-off is deliberate.
VMware Validated Solutions are prescriptive, supported blueprints
They sit above VCF, not beside it
They reduce risk by constraining choice

vIDB = the “SSO engine”
VCF SSO = the fleet-level “SSO product experience” that drives vIDB configuration and pushes/coordinates it across components
In real deployments, vIDB is positioned as the central place where you integrate with upstream identity sources (for example AD/LDAPS, or “corporate IdPs” such as Okta/Entra/ADFS), and then VCF components are configured to trust/use that SSO configuration.<br>At a high level, VCF Identity Broker is an identity federation/intermediary service that sits between your enterprise identity provider (e.g., Okta, Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD, Ping Identity, ADFS, LDAP/OpenLDAP) and the VCF platform services (like <a data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter Server</a>, <a data-href="NSX Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX Manager</a>, and the <a data-href="VCF Operations" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/vcf-operations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations</a>/<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> stack).It:
Accepts authentication from an external IdP using modern protocols (e.g., SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect) or directory services (LDAP/AD).
Issues federated/standard tokens to VCF components to enable central SSO across the environment.
Provides user and group provisioning integration (SCIM, Just-In-Time provisioning, LDAP sync) so that IdP users and groups can be mapped into VCF RBAC.
vIDB acts as a universal “identity broker” in a federation chain—it trusts your enterprise IdP and then vouches for those identities to VMware Cloud Foundation services.The vIDB service is described in the field as supporting at least:

Modern cloud IdPs: Okta, Ping Identity, Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD, ADFS.
Traditional directory services: Active Directory via LDAP, OpenLDAP. Centralized authentication and SSO—better user experience and reduced login friction.
Integrates with corporate IdPs—enables MFA, policy enforcement, and audit logging from your enterprise identity layer.
Scalable deployment options—embedded for simplicity, appliance for scale/resilience. Adds an additional component to deploy and manage (especially in appliance mode).
Requires careful role mapping and RBAC planning so that IdP groups/roles map correctly to VCF permissions.
Legacy components may not participate in SSO the same way — they might still require local accounts even after VCF Identity Broker is configured.
A very real operational problem in multi-tenant systems is: Users get recreated/reidentified when you switch identity providers (or change claims, subject formats, etc.).
If a tenant starts on IdP-A and later moves to IdP-B, you want a controlled way to preserve user access and authorization mappings.
Remapping is the “bridge” that avoids breaking RBAC simply because the upstream identity changed.
Remapping is usually about reconciling user identities inside the platform’s internal user store / directory representation when the upstream IdP changes. It’s not “magic federation”—it’s an administrative identity-correlation operation.
Upstream IdP (Okta/Entra/ADFS/LDAP-backed federation)
Authenticates the human. Issues identity assertions / tokens.

Provides a GitOps delivery model for application deployments
Useful for declarative automation and continuous deployment workflows Supervisor Services are the core platform building blocks that make vSphere Supervisor extensible and cloud-capable.
These services cover Kubernetes lifecycle, storage, registry, ingress, DNS, certificate management, backup, data services consumption, secrets, and more.
They are installed per Supervisor Cluster, managed by platform administrators, and consumed by tenant workloads or automation layers like VCF Automation.
There is also a Labs Catalog for experimental or early-stage Supervisor Services.

A vSphere Cluster (or Supervisor Cluster) is a logical grouping of ESX hosts that vCenter treats as a single resource pool and failure domain.
It exists only in vCenter
ESX hosts do not know they are “in a cluster”.
When you create a cluster in vCenter Server, you are telling:
“*These ESX hosts agree to be scheduled, balanced, and failed over together.”This enables cluster-level logic, such as

Ensure enough spare capacity exists to restart VMs after a failure.
If Admission Control says “no”:
Nothing is broken
You are overcommitted beyond your failure tolerance
This is HA doing its job, not being restrictive.VCF HA is infrastructure HA, not cloud-native app HA.❌ Turning off HA to “fit more VMs”
→ Silent loss of failure guarantees❌ Expecting HA to replace app clustering
→ Wrong layer❌ Confusing HA with zero downtime
→ There is always a restart
HA in VCF = vSphere HA, standardized and enforced
It restarts VMs after host failure
It does not provide zero-downtime or app-level resilience
It is a non-optional baseline for VCF design assumptions

Runs inside its own virtual machine
Has a dedicated Linux kernel
Provides strong isolation similar to a VM
Is optimized for fast startup and low overhead
In other words, a vSphere Pod combines the security and isolation of a VM with the developer experience of containers.So:
API semantics → Kubernetes
<br>Runtime semantics → <a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a> / VM
Traditional Kubernetes Pods:
Share a Linux kernel
Rely on namespaces + cgroups
Are fast and efficient
But have weaker isolation (from a hypervisor POV)
vSphere Pods were created to:
Give VM-grade isolation
While keeping Pod-level developer UX
For multi-tenant / regulated environments
This matters a lot for:
Service providers
Telco
Regulated enterprise workloads
“Pods from different customers must never share a kernel” Strong Isolation
Each vSphere Pod runs in its own VM with a dedicated kernel, providing isolation comparable to a full virtual machine.
Precise Resource Allocation
CPU, memory, and storage are allocated exactly as specified for the workload.
Efficient Scheduling<br>
vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (<a data-href="DRS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/cluster-services/drs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DRS</a>) places vSphere Pods on appropriate hosts based on available resources.
High Performance
The lightweight VM model preserves fast startup times while avoiding the “noisy neighbor” problem common in shared-kernel container environments.
Operational Visibility
Administrators can monitor and manage vSphere Pods using standard vSphere tools and workflows.
vSphere Pods are compatible with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification.They can run OCI-compliant container images, provided the container image supports the target environment.<br>For a vSphere Pod to run, a <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> must be created on the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/inventory-objects/supervisor-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-298459bc-258c-4430-81a5-fb5330d7ce24.webp" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vsphere-pod-298459bc-258c-4430-81a5-fb5330d7ce24.webp" target="_self"><br>vSphere Pods rely on <a data-href="NSX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX</a> networking.Key characteristics:

Regular Kubernetes:Node (Linux)

No shared kubelet per “node”
Each pod is scheduled directly by vSphere
Kubernetes still thinks it’s scheduling Pods — but vSphere translates that into VM placement.So in vSphereland, “One Pod ~= Tiny VM”<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-4.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vsphere-pod-4.png" target="_self">
Kubernetes: Decides which pod should run vSphere: Decides where the pod-VM runs
Enforces CPU, memory, NUMA, HA, DRS
This is what “Kubernetes-native mode” really looks like under the hood. From the Pod’s perspective:
It has an IP
It mounts volumes
It exposes ports
Under the hood:
Networking is NSX-backed
Storage is datastore-policy-backe
Attach/detach happens at VM granularity
Again: Pod UX, VM machinery.
Despite the VM runtime, vSphere Pods still use:
Pod specs
Containers
Init containers
ConfigMaps
Volume mounts
Pod lifecycle (create/delete/restart)
Kubernetes Services (with some constraints)
So developers mostly don’t care—and that is by design. Regular Pod → process in a shared OS
vSphere Pod → process in its own micro-VM
Or:
Regular K8s → Linux container model
vSphere Pods → “micro-VM container” model
Essentially: vSphere Pods are not regular Kubernetes Pods
They are Pod-shaped workloads backed by per-Pod VMs
Kubernetes API semantics remain intact
Runtime isolation is hypervisor-level
This is intentional and central to Supervisor’s design vSphere Pods are VM-backed Kubernetes pods with strong isolation.
<br>They run on <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> hosts using Spherelet and Supervisor integration.

These pods use hardware-backed memory encryption to protect guest memory from being accessed by the hypervisor or other privileged components.This capability is powered by AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization–Encrypted State (SEV-ES).A confidential vSphere Pod is a Kubernetes Pod that runs inside a virtual machine configured with SEV-ES: This ensures that:
Memory contents are encrypted
CPU register state is protected
The hypervisor cannot read or tamper with guest memory
This is especially useful for workloads that require strong isolation guarantees, such as handling sensitive data or running regulated workloads.To enable confidential vSphere Pods, the following requirements must be met:
<br>The <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> host must run on hardware that supports AMD SEV-ES. <br><a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> 7.0 Update 2 or later is required.
SEV-ES must be enabled in the system BIOS.When enabling SEV-ES, configure the following: Minimum SEV non-ES ASID count
This value must be set to:
number of SEV-ES VMs + number of confidential vSphere Pods + 1 Example: 100 SEV-ES VMs
128 confidential vSphere Pods
→ Minimum value = 229 The maximum allowed value is typically 500, depending on hardware. To deploy a confidential pod, you enable SEV-ES at the pod specification level.Create a YAML manifest with the following key elements:
Enable confidential pod support via annotation
Explicitly set memory requests and limits (they must match)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: name: photon-pod namespace: my-podvm-ns annotations: vmware/confidential-pod: enabled
spec: restartPolicy: Never containers: - name: photon image: wcp-docker-ci.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/vmware/photon:1.0 command: ["/bin/sh"] args: ["-c", "while true; do echo hello, world!; sleep 1; done"] resources: requests: memory: "512Mi" limits: memory: "512Mi" Memory requests and limits must be identical for confidential pods.
Apply the manifest:kubectl apply -f &lt;yaml-file&gt;.yaml
Once submitted:
<br>The Scheduler selects an <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> host that supports SEV-ES
If no compatible host is available, the Pod remains unscheduled
If scheduled successfully, the Pod runs with encrypted memory
You can verify the pod deployment using:kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;
From the vSphere side, administrators can see the pod listed with:Encryption Mode: Confidential Compute
Confidential vSphere Pods use AMD SEV-ES to protect memory contents.
Encryption is enforced at the hardware level and is transparent to workloads.
The feature requires: Compatible hardware
ESX 7.0 U2 or later
BIOS configuration for SEV-ES Configuration is done declaratively using Kubernetes YAML.
The Supervisor ensures scheduling only onto capable hosts.

It’s the framework the mind uses to understand, predict, and decide—often without conscious awareness.It is a map, not the territory.In my view, a mental model is:
A conceptual structure in the mind
Built from experience, learning, and assumptions
Used to explain cause → effect and anticipate outcomes
It answers questions like:
“If I do X, what will probably happen?”
“Why did that fail?”
“What matters here—and what doesn’t?”
Imagine driving in a foreign city.
The actual city is reality: complex, messy, and full of detail
Your mental model is a rough subway map in your head
That map:
Omits small streets
Distorts distances
Focuses only on what helps you get from A → B
It is useful precisely because it ignores detail—even if it’s inaccurate in places.That is what this (mostly) directed acyclic graph of documents (with occasional—intentional—loops) is trying to establish for <a data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VMware Cloud Foundation</a>: A navigable mental map, not an exhaustive representation of reality.The goal is not to describe everything, but to surface the abstractions that help me (and you, dear reader) reason correctly.Mental models exist because the human brain cannot process full reality in real time.Mental models:
Reduce cognitive load
Enable faster decisions
Allow generalization from experience
A single concept can be viewed through multiple overlapping mental models.For example, a database can be seen as:
A storage engine
A consistency system
A failure domain

Those are implementation details.VCF asks only:
Where does it run?
Who owns it?
What resources does it consume?
What policies apply?
What lifecycle rules govern it?
If those questions can be answered, VCF is satisfied.VCF exists above:

If VCF tried to manage each kind of workload differently, it would:
explode in complexity
duplicate logic
couple business policy to runtime mechanics
So instead, VCF defines:
Workload = Policy + Placement + Lifecycle + Resources
Everything else is delegated downward.All of the following are equally valid workloads in VCF:VCF deliberately does not rank or privilege any of these.In VCF, a workload is anything that consumes platform resources and is subject to platform policy—its internal shape is intentionally irrelevant.
VCF intentionally erases runtime distinctions

The kind or form of the workload becomes irrelevant.VCF does not care:
whether the workload uses containerd or not
<br>whether it’s a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vSphere Pod" data-href="vSphere Pod" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/architecture-and-core-concepts/vsphere-pod.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PodVM</a> or classic VM
whether it runs Go, Java, or Bash
whether it was deployed via Helm, kubectl, or Terraform
whether it is “cloud-native” or “legacy”
Those are runtime-layer concerns, not platform-layer concerns.
A power grid doesn’t care if you plug in a toaster or a server rack—only how much power you draw and what safety rules apply.
This is why statements like these are true:
“Pod workloads are not special.”
“VM workloads are not special.”
“Guest clusters are just workloads.”
“Infrastructure doesn’t care about your app model.”
So, you don’t fight against the platform to fit the workload in; you design the workload to fit the platform’s (opinionated) invariants.To internalize VCF, don’t think in:
Pods vs VMs
Containers vs Processes
Control Planes vs Data Planes
<br>Instead, think in <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>:
Who owns this?

Has its own CPU, memory, disk, and network
Runs its own operating system
Is isolated from other VMs
Believes it owns real hardware (even though it doesn’t)
The key component is the hypervisor.The hypervisor:
Intercepts CPU instructions
Schedules CPU time
Maps virtual memory → physical memory
Virtualizes I/O (disk, NIC, GPU, etc.)
From the VM’s perspective:
“I am running on bare metal.”
From reality:
“You are one of many guests sharing a host.”
A VM is not just an OS. It consists of:
Virtual hardware vCPU(s)
vRAM
Virtual disk(s)
Virtual NIC(s) Firmware BIOS or UEFI Operating system Linux, Windows, BSD, etc. Applications Databases, web servers, middleware, etc. Even though the term VM is generic, VCF treats the VM as a first-class workload unit:
A VM is: A managed workload
Governed by policies
Scheduled onto clusters
Subject to lifecycle operations (create, move, snapshot, delete) VCF doesn’t care why the VM exists
It cares how to place, secure, move, and operate it A VM is a full computer implemented in software
It runs an OS and applications like a physical machine
The hypervisor provides isolation and resource sharing
VMs remain foundational—even in modern cloud platforms
In VCF, a VM is a core workload primitive, not a legacy artifact

“How do I deploy and operate a multi-VM application as a single unit?”
Before Kubernetes, before Helm, before Operators—this was VMware’s answer.vApp: OnlineStore
├── Web VM
├── API VM
└── Database VM
You can:
Power on/off the whole application
Clone or export it
Track it as a single object
Critical feature.You can define:
DB starts first
App tier next
Web tier last
Reverse order on shutdown
This was huge in pre-container days.Inside a vApp you can:
Define isolated networks
Connect VMs to internal-only networks
Attach uplinks at the vApp boundary
It is like a “mini datacenter boundary for this application”.vApps support:
OVF / OVA packaging
Application-level metadata
Deployment parameters (IP, hostname, etc.)
This made vApps attractive for:
ISVs
Appliances
Repeatable deployments
vApp is an organizational and orchestration construct, not a runtime.vApps were ahead of their time, but eventually outpaced by containers.vApps are still relevant in:

Persistent volume requests from a VKS cluster are passed to the Supervisor, which handles storage provisioning.The Cluster API provides declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs for:
Creating clusters
Configuring clusters
Managing cluster lifecycle
Inputs to the Cluster API include:
A resource describing the cluster itself
Resources describing the virtual machines that make up the cluster
Resources describing cluster add-ons
The Virtual Machine Service provides a declarative, Kubernetes-style API for managing virtual machines and associated vSphere resources.Key concepts include:
Virtual Machine Classes, which define reusable hardware configurations
Lifecycle management of control plane and worker node VMs that host a VKS cluster
The components that run inside a VKS cluster fall into four functional areas:
Authentication Webhook
A webhook running inside the cluster that validates user authentication tokens. Container Storage Interface (CSI) Plugin
A paravirtualized CSI driver that integrates with CNS through the Supervisor. Container Network Interface (CNI) Plugin
Provides pod networking capabilities. Cloud Provider Implementation
Supports creation and management of Kubernetes LoadBalancer services.
The VKS API is used to provision and manage VKS clusters. It is a declarative API accessed using kubectl and YAML manifests.You can download the VMware-enhanced kubectl binary from the Supervisor API endpoint.With the declarative model:
You define the desired state (number of nodes, VM sizes, Kubernetes version, storage, etc.)
VKS reconciles the actual state to match the desired state
To manage a cluster:
Define the cluster configuration in YAML.
Apply it using kubectl.
Update the YAML to modify the cluster over time. <br><a data-href="VKS Cluster Networking" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/kubernetes-runtimes/vks/platform-integration/vks-cluster-networking.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VKS Cluster Networking</a>

Healthy
All nodes and components are healthy, and a heartbeat is received every minute.
Unhealthy
One or more of the following are unhealthy: One or more control plane nodes
One or more cluster components Warning
A cluster enters a warning state when: One or more worker nodes are unhealthy or unknown, or
One or more nodes (control plane or worker) report a warning condition Unknown
The cluster is marked as unknown if: One or more control plane nodes are in an unknown state, or
No heartbeat has been received for more than three minutes Node health is derived from the NodeReady condition and other node-level signals such as:
MemoryPressure
DiskPressure
OutOfDisk
The node’s health state is evaluated as follows:
NodeReady is True
All other conditions are healthy NodeReady is False, or

Nothing new is introduced; this is purely a clarity and organization pass so the conceptual layers are easy to understand and reference.VKS (vSphere Kubernetes Service) provides managed Kubernetes clusters running on vSphere.
It operates within the VCF Automation framework and relies on the Supervisor to provision and manage resources.VKS cluster management introduces a hierarchical model that separates:

Assigned to a vSphere Namespace
Exposed to VKS clusters deployed within that namespace
The storage policies determine:
Which datastores can be used
How volumes are provisioned
How placement and availability rules are enforced
Based on the assigned storage policies:

These StorageClasses are made available inside the VKS cluster
Each storage policy results in two StorageClass variants:
One with Immediate volume binding
One with WaitForFirstConsumer volume binding
This allows DevOps teams to choose the appropriate provisioning behavior based on workload requirements.VKS clusters integrate with vSphere storage using Paravirtual CSI (pvCSI).
pvCSI is a modified version of the standard vSphere CNS-CSI driver
It runs inside the VKS cluster
It handles all storage-related operations initiated from the cluster
The pvCSI driver does not communicate directly with vCenter or CNS. Instead:
The pvCSI driver forwards storage requests to the Supervisor
The Supervisor routes the request to CNS (Cloud Native Storage)
<br><a data-href="CNS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/cns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CNS</a> performs the actual storage operation in vSphere
Unlike CNS-CSI, pvCSI:
Does not require vCenter credentials
Operates using a service account within the namespace
Relies on the Supervisor for secure mediation

A DevOps engineer creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in the VKS cluster.
The request is received by the pvCSI driver.
pvCSI forwards the request to the Supervisor.
The Supervisor invokes the CNS API in vCenter to create the volume.
Once the volume is created, the information propagates back through the Supervisor.
The PVC and corresponding PV appear as Bound in both: The VKS cluster
The Supervisor view This ensures consistent visibility and lifecycle tracking across all layers.
VKS clusters rely on vSphere storage policies for persistent storage.
Storage policies determine where and how volumes are provisioned.
The Supervisor mediates all storage operations between VKS and vSphere.
pvCSI enables secure, credential-free storage operations from inside the cluster.
Storage resources appear consistently in both the VKS cluster and Supervisor views.

The VM is the isolation primitive
The Pod is the semantic primitive
The container image is payload, not a process model
So the VM is not “pretending to be a container”—it is implementing the Pod abstraction using a VM instead of a process.
Pod (Kubernetes API object) └─ Backed by └─ Ultra-lightweight VM └─ ESX └─ Hardware
It is:

VCF’s value is:
Running both on the same physical infrastructure, with unified policy and automation, without forcing one model onto the other. Trying to manage pods like VMs breaks Kubernetes.

No reboot. No app restart.

It is transport, not policy.
“VCF places workloads with vMotion” → No. DRS places; vMotion moves.
“vMotion is free” → No. It consumes network and CPU headroom.
“vMotion fixes capacity issues” → No. It redistributes load only.
vMotion doesn’t choose destinations, and it doesn’t judge priorities—it just moves things safely when told.
vMotion = zero-downtime VM movement

Always present and assumed in VCF designs
Necessary—but never sufficient—by itself

Consumed transparently by higher layers
Not tenant-facing by default
This is usually what people mean when they say “policy”.This is where Policy becomes a named, explicit, governable object.<br>In <a data-href="VCF Automation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a>, policies define constraints and guardrails for consumers.Examples:
Who can deploy what
Where workloads can land
What sizes, images, or networks are allowed
Lease durations and approval requirements
Typical policy categories:
Placement policies: Which clusters, regions, zones
Sizing policies: CPU, memory, storage limits
Image policies: Approved OS images only
Network policies: allowed networks / isolation
Approval policies: manual gates for certain actions
Lease policies: TTL and reclamation rules
These policies are evaluated before provisioning.<br>In <a data-href="VCF Automation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a>, policies are usually scoped to:<br>

Organization is not a technical runtime boundary—It is a business-facing logical entity that defines who is allowed to consume cloud capabilities, under which rules, and with which visibility.An Organization is the top-level administrative boundary.It is used to:
Group users, projects, and resources
Apply policies and governance
Define ownership and access boundaries
Support multi-tenant separation
An organization typically maps to a business unit or tenant.Organizations exist only in VCF Automation, not in Kubernetes.It is the outermost “contract boundary” for consumption, not execution.An Organization is a logical tenant boundary that groups identity, policy, quotas, visibility, and approval flows for consuming infrastructure and platform services.It answers:
Who is consuming?
What are they allowed to consume?
Under which business rules?
—not how workloads actually run.

RBAC
Resource quotas
Network isolation
Storage policies
Pod security boundaries
Runtime blast radius
This is where:
Kubernetes says “no”
vSphere enforces limits
Workloads are actually prevented from crossing boundaries Namespace = hard enforcement boundary
<br>Organizations define intent and <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>.
An Organization:
Defines who is allowed to create tenants
Defines how many tenants
Defines under which rules
Defines approval and lifecycle policies
It’s closer to:
“Who is allowed to mint isolation boundaries?”
not:
“Where isolation happens.”
A single Organization can own:
Multiple Projects

Acme Corp is still one customer: One billing entity
One governance envelope
One policy domain This construct enables the following scenarios (which would have been impossible otherwise).Classic need:
Dev / Stage / Prod
Regulated vs non-regulated
Different trust zones
All under:
One contract
One identity plane
One catalog
Example:
Organization = “Platform Team”
Projects = internal product teams
Namespaces = per-team isolation
This would break if Organization == Namespace.Example:
Organization = External customer
Projects = customer environments
Namespaces = actual enforcement boundaries
Same model works for:
Internal IT
SaaS providers
Telco multi-tenant platforms
If something must be isolated, it must be isolated at the namespace level.Anything above that:

Is visibility
Is policy
Is economy
Organizations define who may create tenants; namespaces are the tenants.Similar to:
AWS Account
Azure Subscription (with Management Groups layered above)
GCP Project (with Org/Folder hierarchy)
But in VCF, it’s explicitly framed as consumption-first, not infrastructure-first.
Separates consumers (e.g., companies, business units, external customers)
Enforces isolation in: Identity and Access
Visibility
Quotas and Limits
Chargeback / showback Organizations are where policies attach, such as:
Who can request what
Approval workflows
Budget limits
Lease durations
Allowed regions / environments
Allowed workload types (VM, Kubernetes, services)
These policies then flow downward.Everything inside an Organization is:
Visible only to that Organization (unless shared)
Governed consistently
This includes:
Projects
Blueprints / templates
Catalog items
Requests
Cost views

└── (maps indirectly to) └── Cloud Zones └── Infrastructure (vSphere, Supervisor, VKS, etc.) Infrastructure never belongs to an Organization
Consumption always does
Organization deliberately hides infrastructure topology.From the Organization’s point of view:
<br>There is no <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a>
No cluster
No datastore
<br>No <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a>
There is only:
“What can I request?”
“What am I allowed to use?”
“Who approves this?”
“How much does it cost?”
This abstraction enables:
Multi-tenant platforms
Internal private clouds
Managed services
SaaS-like experience on top of VCF
If Organization is “who is the customer”,
then Project is “what they are working on”.Typical mapping:Organization: Acme Corp
├── Project: Acme-Prod
├── Project: Acme-Stage
└── Project: Acme-Dev
Projects:
Scope quotas
Bind to cloud zones
<br>Eventually map to <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s or runtime constructs
Organizations never do.

It hosts the management plane—the services that build, operate, upgrade, and secure the rest of the cloud.Put simply:
If the Management Cluster is down, you can’t manage the cloud—only the workloads keep running.
<br>The Management Cluster is part of the <a data-href="Management Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/management-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Management Domain</a> (a special Workload Domain).

<br><a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a>

These components do not belong to the tenants. They belong to the platform.It runs the services that:
Define topology
Enforce lifecycle sequencing
Validate upgrades
Maintain inventory and state
All VCF lifecycle operations (create domain, expand cluster, upgrade stack) are coordinated from here.Tenant workloads do not run here (by design):
No tenant VMs
No tenant Kubernetes workloads
No customer apps
This protects:
Stability
Security
Upgrade safety
It is not:
A tenant cluster
A workload execution environment
A shared resource pool for apps
Optional or replaceable
Treating it like a general-purpose cluster is a serious anti-pattern.This separation ensures:
Predictable upgrades (no tenant interference)
Clear blast-radius control
Strong security boundaries
Operational sanity at scale
It’s the same pattern used by:
Kubernetes (control plane vs worker nodes)
Public clouds (provider plane vs customer plane) Management Cluster → Kubernetes control plane nodes
Guest Clusters → Kubernetes worker nodes
SDDC Manager → Cluster lifecycle operator
You wouldn’t run apps on the Kubernetes control plane; same rule applies here.
Management Cluster is typically: Small (minimum viable size)
Highly available
Strictly protected If it fails: Existing workloads keep running
You lose management, scaling, and upgrades until restored The Management Cluster runs the cloud, not the workloads

So the formal relationship is:
A Supervisor Cluster is a capability of a vSphere Cluster, not a different cluster type.
But, it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and it surely is a very-sophisticated duck: Operationally, and practically, it is the same thing.<br>A Supervisor Cluster is a Kubernetes control plane that runs on and transforms a <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/inventory-objects/vsphere-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> into a Kubernetes-aware platform.For the ontology-enthusiasts out there:This matters a lot.

It stays available if one of the zones goes down.
Examples of a cross-zonal datastore: stretched vSAN, stretched vSAN storage cluster, metro storage cluster, non-stretched vSAN or vSAN storage cluster deployed from hosts across multiple zones.

VCF Edge brings “the VCF way” to thousands of small, remote sites—without turning each site into a snowflake.
<br><img alt="VCF-Edge-1 1.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-edge-1-1.png" target="_self">Edge sites typically have constraints that central data centers do not:
Small host counts (often 2–4 nodes)
Limited on-site staff (or none)
Intermittent or high-latency connectivity (an edge-site not having Internet connectivity for a month is not uncommon)
Strict uptime requirements
Local data-residency or latency needs
VCF Edge is about operating under those constraints without abandoning platform discipline.However, even at the edge, the core VCF principles remain:
Centralized lifecycle control
Validated configurations
Strong isolation and security
Declarative operations
Consistent operational model
What changes is scale, footprint, and placement—not the philosophy.Central / Regional Site
├── Management Domain (SDDC Manager, vCenter, NSX)
├── Automation &amp; Ops
│
└── Edge Sites (many) ├── Small Workload Domain (or cluster) ├── Local workloads (VMs / K8s) ├── Local networking &amp; security └── Centrally managed lifecycle
So:
While, management stays centralized
execution happens at the edge
Depending on use case:
Telco workloads (RAN, core, MEC)
Retail store systems
Factory / OT workloads
Branch office services
Latency-sensitive apps
These workloads:
Run locally
Are managed remotely
Must survive site isolation <br><a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a> governs lifecycle
Platform admins operate from a hub
Edge sites follow validated patterns Workloads keep running if disconnected
Local failover is possible
Management resumes when connectivity returns
This balance is critical for an edge site.VCF Edge supports:
Single-tenant edge (most common)
Logical multi-tenancy via: <br><a data-href="Project" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/consumption-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>s

Physical isolation per tenant is less common at edge
Operational simplicity is prioritized
Edge is where: Hyperscalers struggle with footprint and latency Enterprises need consistency across thousands of sites Telco and regulated industries dominate Unlike a traditional cloud or data center (where workloads are centralized to regions), edge is decentralized, and geographically spread. This is topologically opposite to a typical cloud deployment. <br>

VCF Edge extends VCF to remote, constrained sites
Management remains centralized
Workloads run locally and survive disconnection
Edge is a pattern, not a separate product
It prioritizes consistency over customization

a Helm release
Those are implementation details.VCF asks only:
Where does it run?
Who owns it?
What resources does it consume?
What policies apply?
What lifecycle rules govern it?
If those questions can be answered, VCF is satisfied.VCF exists above:

If VCF tried to manage each kind of workload differently, it would:
explode in complexity
duplicate logic
couple business policy to runtime mechanics
So instead, VCF defines:
Workload = Policy + Placement + Lifecycle + Resources
Everything else is delegated downward.All of the following are equally valid workloads in VCF:VCF deliberately does not rank or privilege any of these.In VCF, a workload is anything that consumes platform resources and is subject to platform policy—its internal shape is intentionally irrelevant.
VCF intentionally erases runtime distinctions

The kind or form of the workload becomes irrelevant.VCF does not care:
whether the workload uses containerd or not
<br>whether it’s a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vSphere Pod" data-href="vSphere Pod" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/architecture-and-core-concepts/vsphere-pod.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PodVM</a> or classic VM
whether it runs Go, Java, or Bash
whether it was deployed via Helm, kubectl, or Terraform
whether it is “cloud-native” or “legacy”
Those are runtime-layer concerns, not platform-layer concerns.
A power grid doesn’t care if you plug in a toaster or a server rack—only how much power you draw and what safety rules apply.
This is why statements like these are true:
“Pod workloads are not special.”
“VM workloads are not special.”
“Guest clusters are just workloads.”
“Infrastructure doesn’t care about your app model.”
So, you don’t fight against the platform to fit the workload in; you design the workload to fit the platform’s (opinionated) invariants.To internalize VCF, don’t think in:
Pods vs VMs
Containers vs Processes
Control Planes vs Data Planes
<br>Instead, think in <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>:

What are its limits?

It hosts the management plane—the services that build, operate, upgrade, and secure the rest of the cloud.Put simply:
If the Management Cluster is down, you can’t manage the cloud—only the workloads keep running.
<br>The Management Cluster is part of the <a data-href="Management Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/management-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Management Domain</a> (a special Workload Domain).

These components do not belong to the tenants. They belong to the platform.It runs the services that:
Define topology
Enforce lifecycle sequencing
Validate upgrades
Maintain inventory and state
All VCF lifecycle operations (create domain, expand cluster, upgrade stack) are coordinated from here.Tenant workloads do not run here (by design):
No tenant VMs
No tenant Kubernetes workloads
No customer apps
This protects:
Stability
Security
Upgrade safety
It is not:
A tenant cluster
A workload execution environment
A shared resource pool for apps
Optional or replaceable
Treating it like a general-purpose cluster is a serious anti-pattern.This separation ensures:
Predictable upgrades (no tenant interference)
Clear blast-radius control
Strong security boundaries
Operational sanity at scale
It’s the same pattern used by:
Kubernetes (control plane vs worker nodes)
Public clouds (provider plane vs customer plane) Management Cluster → Kubernetes control plane nodes
Guest Clusters → Kubernetes worker nodes
SDDC Manager → Cluster lifecycle operator
You wouldn’t run apps on the Kubernetes control plane; same rule applies here.
Management Cluster is typically: Small (minimum viable size)
Highly available
Strictly protected If it fails: Existing workloads keep running
You lose management, scaling, and upgrades until restored The Management Cluster runs the cloud, not the workloads

It is a thin wrapper over SDDC Manager APIs, with guardrails.This is:
A faster iteration than REST during ops
An easier integration into shell scripts
Provides consistent auth and context handling
CLIs are not separate systems — they are API clients.These are language bindings.Where available, VMware/Broadcom provides SDKs that wrap REST APIs in native language constructs:
Object models
Typed requests/responses
Auth helpers
Pagination, retries, error handling

You are building a platform or product
You need maintainable, testable code

“Given raw hardware, how do I get to a fully functional VCF Management Domain with SDDC Manager running?”

Validating network configuration
Validating DNS / NTP / IPAM

Think of it as a fail-fast safety gate: Better to stop early than build a broken cloud.VCF Installer typically operates with:
Structured input (JSON / guided wizard)
Explicit topology definitions
Explicit IP assignments
You declare what you want, and the installer executes a deterministic build.There is no concept of “incremental evolution” here: That belongs to SDDC Manager.It is not:
A lifecycle manager
A long-running control plane
A tenant or consumption interface
A policy engine
An operations tool

It is not used daily
It does not manage upgrades
It does not manage workload domains

VCF Installer steps out of the picture
You can think of it as:
VCF Installer creates SDDC Manager; SDDC Manager creates and manages everything else.
A natural question is: “Why not just use SDDC Manager from the start?”Because:
SDDC Manager itself must be deployed
That deployment requires validated sequencing
That sequencing must run before SDDC Manager exists

VMware Cloud is how VMware delivers and operates VMware platforms as a service across public, private, and hybrid clouds.
VCF is often the engine; VMware Cloud is the service wrapper.Examples include:
VMware Cloud on AWS
VMware Cloud on Azure
VMware Cloud on Google Cloud
VMware Cloud on OCI
These provide:
Native VMware stacks
Operated as managed services
Tight integration with hyperscaler services
From the customer’s point of view:
“I get vSphere/NSX/vSAN without running the platform myself.”
This is where things look very similar to VCF:
VMware (or a partner) runs VCF on your behalf
Can be hosted: On your premises
In a partner data center You consume it as a cloud service
Regardless of flavor, VMware Cloud aims to deliver:
Consistent VMware operational model
Reduced platform operational burden
Predictable lifecycle management
Enterprise-grade security and compliance
Hybrid portability (move workloads across clouds)
It is not:
A replacement for Kubernetes-native clouds
A single UI or API
A single SKU
Always customer-operated
It is a portfolio strategy, not a monolith.VMware Cloud = “VMware runs it for you”
VCF = “The platform being run”
vSphere/NSX = “The building blocks”
Or in cloud terms:
VMware Cloud ≈ AWS Managed Services
VCF ≈ AWS internal platform (you don’t see it directly)
vSphere/NSX ≈ EC2 / VPC equivalents Customers want cloud economics
But need enterprise control
And want to reuse VMware skills and tooling
VMware Cloud is VMware’s answer to:
“Give me cloud without forcing me to rewrite everything.” VMware Cloud is a service model, not a product
It spans public, private, and hybrid clouds

Day 1 frames the building
Day 2 is living in it for years
Or:
Day 0 → Existence
Day 1 → Enablement
Day 2 → Sustainment
Day 2 is continuous, not a phase you “finish”.This is the obvious part—but it’s only the surface.
Deploy workloads (VMs, Pods, clusters)
Scale up/down
Start / stop / suspend
Migrate workloads
Retire workloads
Day 2 starts the feedback loop.
Platform health monitoring
Workload health monitoring
Capacity tracking
Performance baselines
Alert tuning (noise reduction)
Bad alerts = ignored alerts = outages.The real test of architecture.
Host failures
Network partitions
Storage degradation
Control plane issues
Application outages
Includes:
[HA] / [DRS] behavior
Failover validation
Backup &amp; restore
DR testing

All while:
Workloads are running
SLAs are enforced
This is why VCF is opinionated.Reality: resources are finite.
Capacity planning
Quota adjustments
Overcommit tuning
Chargeback / showback
Cluster expansion
This is where finance meets engineering.Day 1 defines policies.
Day 2 fights drift.
Detect misconfigurations
Enforce standards
Handle exceptions
Reconcile “special cases”
Without this, entropy wins.Day 2 success is measured socially, not technically.
Self-service reliability
Automation success rates
Time-to-resource
Support ticket volume
Developer trust
A stable platform feels boring. That’s success.Day 2 never freezes architecture.
Introduce new workload types
Add regions / clusters
Enable new services
Deprecate old patterns
VCF must evolve without reset.

You must log in to the Broadcom Developer Portal with valid credentials.
Access is typically tied to an active support contract or partner agreement.
The SDK download link is hidden until your account is verified for entitlement.
VCF Gated SDK provides Java and Python libraries, API bindings, utilities, and sample code to automate and integrate with <a data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VMware Cloud Foundation</a>.
Contains proprietary VMware/Broadcom code.
Ensures only licensed customers/partners can use it.
Helps control distribution of sensitive API bindings and internal tooling.
VCF is not a generic API platform; it is a validated system.
Some APIs:
Control core lifecycle
Mutate global topology
Bypass normal UI guardrails
Can easily create unsupported states
Exposing these APIs broadly would:
Fragment platform behavior
Break upgrade guarantees
Explode support matrices
So VMware/Broadcom chooses controlled exposure instead of full openness.Gated SDKs often include APIs that:
Drive SDDC Manager internal workflows
Orchestrate LCM sequencing
Mutate domain-level state machines
Access pre-GA or evolving models
Bypass tenant-safe abstractions
These are platform-builder APIs, not tenant or end-user APIs.A Gated SDK usually implies one or more of the following:
Explicit enablement flag
Contractual agreement
Limited documentation access
No backward-compatibility guarantees
Direct escalation path to engineering
Strong expectations of platform literacy
You are expected to know what you are doing.A Gated SDK is official, but not democratized.It is not:
Unsupported
A hack
A private backdoor
A “use at your own risk” API
It is supported; but with conditions.If you see something described as a Gated SDK, it usually signals:
“This is powerful”
“This can break invariants”
“This is for platform-level integration”
“You need approval and discipline”
In other words:
This is not a convenience API — it is a responsibility API. A Gated SDK is an official but restricted VCF SDK
It protects lifecycle safety and supportability
It is intended for platform builders, not tenants
Access implies higher expectations and accountability
It exists to balance power vs stability

“Given raw hardware, how do I get to a fully functional VCF Management Domain with SDDC Manager running?”
Once that answer is executed successfully, VCF Installer is done.VCF Installer is responsible for:
Validating hardware readiness
Validating network configuration
Validating DNS / NTP / IPAM
Validating credentials and certificates
Orchestrating the initial deployment of: <br><a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> on hosts

Hardware compatibility (HCL alignment)
Network reachability
MTU consistency
IP pool correctness
Time synchronization
DNS forward/reverse lookup
Credential access
Think of it as a fail-fast safety gate: Better to stop early than build a broken cloud.VCF Installer typically operates with:
Structured input (JSON / guided wizard)
Explicit topology definitions
Explicit IP assignments
You declare what you want, and the installer executes a deterministic build.There is no concept of “incremental evolution” here: That belongs to SDDC Manager.It is not:
A lifecycle manager
A long-running control plane
A tenant or consumption interface
A policy engine
An operations tool
After bring-up:
It is not used daily
It does not manage upgrades
It does not manage workload domains
<br>Those responsibilities move entirely to the <a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a>.Once installation completes:
<br><a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a> becomes the authoritative owner
VCF Installer steps out of the picture
You can think of it as:
VCF Installer creates SDDC Manager; SDDC Manager creates and manages everything else.
A natural question is: “Why not just use SDDC Manager from the start?”Because:
SDDC Manager itself must be deployed
That deployment requires validated sequencing
That sequencing must run before SDDC Manager exists
VCF Installer solves this bootstrapping paradox.
VCF Installer → kubeadm init
<br><a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a> → Kubernetes control plane (after init)

You don’t run kubeadm init every day, and you don’t run VCF Installer every day either.
VCF Installer is a Day-0 tool

<br>Organizations define intent and <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>.An Organization:
Defines who is allowed to create tenants
Defines how many tenants
Defines under which rules
Defines approval and lifecycle policies
It’s closer to:
“Who is allowed to mint isolation boundaries?”
not:
“Where isolation happens.”
A single Organization can own:
<br>Multiple <a data-href="Project" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/consumption-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>s
<br>Each <a data-href="Project" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/consumption-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a> can map to: <br>One <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>
Or several namespaces (depending on policy / model) Organization: Acme Corp
├── Project: Acme-Prod → ns-acme-prod
├── Project: Acme-Stage → ns-acme-stage
├── Project: Acme-Dev → ns-acme-dev
└── Project: Acme-Analytics → ns-acme-analytics
<br>Each <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Supervisor Namespace" data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">namespace</a> is a real tenant boundary.But from a business standpoint:
Acme Corp is still one customer: One billing entity
One governance envelope
One policy domain This construct enables the following scenarios (which would have been impossible otherwise).Classic need:
Dev / Stage / Prod
Regulated vs non-regulated
Different trust zones
All under:
One contract
One identity plane
One catalog
Example:
Organization = “Platform Team”
<br><a data-href="Project" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/consumption-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>s = internal product teams

This would break if Organization == Namespace.Example:
Organization = External customer
<br><a data-href="Project" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/consumption-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>s = customer environments

Same model works for:
Internal IT
SaaS providers
Telco multi-tenant platforms
If something must be isolated, it must be isolated at the namespace level.Anything above that:

Is visibility
Is policy
Is economy
Organizations define who may create tenants; namespaces are the tenants.Similar to:
AWS Account
Azure Subscription (with Management Groups layered above)
GCP Project (with Org/Folder hierarchy)
But in VCF, it’s explicitly framed as consumption-first, not infrastructure-first.
Separates consumers (e.g., companies, business units, external customers)
Enforces isolation in: Identity and Access
Visibility
Quotas and Limits
Chargeback / showback Organizations are where policies attach, such as:
Who can request what
Approval workflows
Budget limits
Lease durations
Allowed regions / environments
Allowed workload types (VM, Kubernetes, services)
These policies then flow downward.Everything inside an Organization is:
Visible only to that Organization (unless shared)
Governed consistently

IaaS = someone else runs the data center; you control the machines.
The cloud provider gives you raw building blocks:
Compute → virtual machines (VMs)
Storage → block, object, file storage
Networking → virtual networks, IPs, load balancers, firewalls
You decide:
Which OS to run
How to configure the machine
What software to install
How to secure and scale it
Analogy:
Owning hardware → buying a house
IaaS → renting an empty apartment (walls and plumbing are there; furniture and rules are up to you) Amazon Web Services → EC2
Microsoft Azure → Virtual Machines
Google Cloud → Compute Engine
All of these give you VMs, networks, and storage—but no application opinion.Example:
IaaS → “Give me a Linux box”
PaaS → “Run my app”
SaaS → “Just let me use the app” Maximum control and flexibility
Works for legacy apps
Fine-grained networking &amp; security
Familiar mental model for infra engineers You manage OS patching and security

Those are implementation details.VCF asks only:
Where does it run?
Who owns it?
What resources does it consume?
What policies apply?
What lifecycle rules govern it?
If those questions can be answered, VCF is satisfied.VCF exists above:

If VCF tried to manage each kind of workload differently, it would:
explode in complexity
duplicate logic
couple business policy to runtime mechanics
So instead, VCF defines:
Workload = Policy + Placement + Lifecycle + Resources
Everything else is delegated downward.All of the following are equally valid workloads in VCF:VCF deliberately does not rank or privilege any of these.In VCF, a workload is anything that consumes platform resources and is subject to platform policy—its internal shape is intentionally irrelevant.
VCF intentionally erases runtime distinctions

The kind or form of the workload becomes irrelevant.VCF does NOT care:
whether the workload uses containerd or not
<br>whether it’s a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vSphere Pod" data-href="vSphere Pod" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/architecture-and-core-concepts/vsphere-pod.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PodVM</a> or classic VM
whether it runs Go, Java, or Bash
whether it was deployed via Helm, kubectl, or Terraform
whether it is “cloud-native” or “legacy”
Those are runtime-layer concerns, not platform-layer concerns.
A power grid doesn’t care if you plug in a toaster or a server rack—only how much power you draw and what safety rules apply.
This is why statements like these are true:
“Pod workloads are not special.”
“VM workloads are not special.”
“Guest clusters are just workloads.”
“Infrastructure doesn’t care about your app model.”
So, you don’t fight against the platform to fit the workload in; you design the workload to fit the platform’s (opinionated) invariants.To internalize VCF, don’t think in:
Pods vs VMs
Containers vs Processes
Control Planes vs Data Planes
<br>Instead, think in <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>:

It is a thin wrapper over SDDC Manager APIs, with guardrails.This is:
A faster iteration than REST during ops
An easier integration into shell scripts
Provides consistent auth and context handling
CLIs are not separate systems — they are API clients.These are language bindings.Where available, VMware/Broadcom provides SDKs that wrap REST APIs in native language constructs:
Object models
Typed requests/responses
Auth helpers
Pagination, retries, error handling

<br>VCF Gated SDK provides Java and Python libraries, API bindings, utilities, and sample code to automate and integrate with <a data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VMware Cloud Foundation</a>.
Contains proprietary VMware/Broadcom code.
Ensures only licensed customers/partners can use it.
Helps control distribution of sensitive API bindings and internal tooling.
VCF is not a generic API platform; it is a validated system.
Some APIs:
Control core lifecycle
Mutate global topology
Bypass normal UI guardrails
Can easily create unsupported states
Exposing these APIs broadly would:
Fragment platform behavior
Break upgrade guarantees
Explode support matrices
So VMware/Broadcom chooses controlled exposure instead of full openness.Gated SDKs often include APIs that:
Drive SDDC Manager internal workflows
Orchestrate LCM sequencing
Mutate domain-level state machines
Access pre-GA or evolving models
Bypass tenant-safe abstractions
These are platform-builder APIs, not tenant or end-user APIs.A Gated SDK usually implies one or more of the following:
Explicit enablement flag
Contractual agreement
Limited documentation access
No backward-compatibility guarantees
Direct escalation path to engineering
Strong expectations of platform literacy
You are expected to know what you are doing.A Gated SDK is official, but not democratized.It is not:
Unsupported
A hack
A private backdoor
A “use at your own risk” API
It is supported; but with conditions.If you see something described as a Gated SDK, it usually signals:
“This is powerful”
“This can break invariants”
“This is for platform-level integration”
“You need approval and discipline”
In other words:
This is not a convenience API — it is a responsibility API. A Gated SDK is an official but restricted VCF SDK
It protects lifecycle safety and supportability
It is intended for platform builders, not tenants
Access implies higher expectations and accountability
It exists to balance power vs stability

“Given raw hardware, how do I get to a fully functional VCF Management Domain with SDDC Manager running?”
Once that answer is executed successfully, VCF Installer is done.VCF Installer is responsible for:
Validating hardware readiness
Validating network configuration
Validating DNS / NTP / IPAM
Validating credentials and certificates
Orchestrating the initial deployment of: <br><a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> on hosts

Hardware compatibility (HCL alignment)
Network reachability

Time synchronization
DNS forward/reverse lookup
Credential access
Think of it as a fail-fast safety gate: Better to stop early than build a broken cloud.VCF Installer typically operates with:
Structured input (JSON / guided wizard)
Explicit topology definitions
Explicit IP assignments
You declare what you want, and the installer executes a deterministic build.<br>There is no concept of “incremental evolution” here: That belongs to <a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a>.It is not:
A lifecycle manager
A long-running control plane
A tenant or consumption interface
A policy engine
An operations tool
After bring-up:
It is not used daily
It does not manage upgrades
It does not manage workload domains
<br>Those responsibilities move entirely to the <a data-href="SDDC Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/sddc-manager/sddc-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC Manager</a>.Once installation completes:

VCF Installer steps out of the picture
You can think of it as:
VCF Installer creates SDDC Manager; SDDC Manager creates and manages everything else.
A natural question is: “Why not just use SDDC Manager from the start?”Because:
SDDC Manager itself must be deployed
That deployment requires validated sequencing
That sequencing must run before SDDC Manager exists
VCF Installer solves this bootstrapping paradox.
VCF Installer → kubeadm init

It hosts the management plane—the services that build, operate, upgrade, and secure the rest of the cloud.Put simply:
If the Management Cluster is down, you can’t manage the cloud—only the workloads keep running.
<br>The Management Cluster is part of the <a data-href="Management Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/management-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Management Domain</a> (a special Workload Domain).

These components do not belong to the tenants. They belong to the platform.It runs the services that:
Define topology
Enforce lifecycle sequencing
Validate upgrades
Maintain inventory and state
All VCF lifecycle operations (create domain, expand cluster, upgrade stack) are coordinated from here.Tenant workloads do not run here (by design):
No tenant VMs
No tenant Kubernetes workloads
No customer apps
This protects:
Stability
Security
Upgrade safety
It is not:
A tenant cluster
A workload execution environment
A shared resource pool for apps
Optional or replaceable
Treating it like a general-purpose cluster is a serious anti-pattern.This separation ensures:
Predictable upgrades (no tenant interference)
Clear blast-radius control
Strong security boundaries
Operational sanity at scale
It’s the same pattern used by:
Kubernetes (control plane vs worker nodes)
Public clouds (provider plane vs customer plane) Management Cluster → Kubernetes control plane nodes
Guest Clusters → Kubernetes worker nodes
SDDC Manager → Cluster lifecycle operator
You wouldn’t run apps on the Kubernetes control plane; same rule applies here.
Management Cluster is typically: Small (minimum viable size)
Highly available
Strictly protected If it fails: Existing workloads keep running
You lose management, scaling, and upgrades until restored The Management Cluster runs the cloud, not the workloads

The overall health of a cluster is determined by aggregating the health of its nodes and components.
Healthy
All nodes and components are healthy, and a heartbeat is received every minute.
Unhealthy
One or more of the following are unhealthy: One or more control plane nodes
One or more cluster components Warning
A cluster enters a warning state when: One or more worker nodes are unhealthy or unknown, or
One or more nodes (control plane or worker) report a warning condition Unknown
The cluster is marked as unknown if: One or more control plane nodes are in an unknown state, or
No heartbeat has been received for more than three minutes Node health is derived from the NodeReady condition and other node-level signals such as:
MemoryPressure
DiskPressure
OutOfDisk
The node’s health state is evaluated as follows:
NodeReady is True
All other conditions are healthy NodeReady is False, or
NodeReady is True, but more than half of the other conditions are unhealthy NodeReady is True
Fewer than half of the other conditions are unhealthy NodeReady is neither True nor False, or
No heartbeat has been received from the node for more than three minutes

Nothing new is introduced; this is purely a clarity and organization pass so the conceptual layers are easy to understand and reference.VKS (vSphere Kubernetes Service) provides managed Kubernetes clusters running on vSphere.
It operates within the VCF Automation framework and relies on the Supervisor to provision and manage resources.VKS cluster management introduces a hierarchical model that separates:

Runs inside its own virtual machine
Has a dedicated Linux kernel
Provides strong isolation similar to a VM
Is optimized for fast startup and low overhead
In other words, a vSphere Pod combines the security and isolation of a VM with the developer experience of containers.So:
API semantics → Kubernetes
<br>Runtime semantics → <a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a> / VM
Traditional Kubernetes Pods:
Share a Linux kernel
Rely on namespaces + cgroups
Are fast and efficient
But have weaker isolation (from a hypervisor POV)
vSphere Pods were created to:
Give VM-grade isolation
While keeping Pod-level developer UX
For multi-tenant / regulated environments
This matters a lot for:
Service providers
Telco
Regulated enterprise workloads
“Pods from different customers must never share a kernel” Strong Isolation
Each vSphere Pod runs in its own VM with a dedicated kernel, providing isolation comparable to a full virtual machine.
Precise Resource Allocation
CPU, memory, and storage are allocated exactly as specified for the workload.
Efficient Scheduling<br>
vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (<a data-href="DRS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/cluster-services/drs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DRS</a>) places vSphere Pods on appropriate hosts based on available resources.
High Performance
The lightweight VM model preserves fast startup times while avoiding the “noisy neighbor” problem common in shared-kernel container environments.
Operational Visibility
Administrators can monitor and manage vSphere Pods using standard vSphere tools and workflows.
vSphere Pods are compatible with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification.They can run OCI-compliant container images, provided the container image supports the target environment.<br>For a vSphere Pod to run, a <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> must be created on the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/inventory-objects/supervisor-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-298459bc-258c-4430-81a5-fb5330d7ce24.webp" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vsphere-pod-298459bc-258c-4430-81a5-fb5330d7ce24.webp" target="_self"><br>vSphere Pods rely on <a data-href="NSX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX</a> networking.Key Characteristics:

Each pod is scheduled directly by vSphere
Kubernetes still thinks it’s scheduling Pods; but, vSphere translates that into VM placement.So in vSphereland, “One Pod ~= A Tiny VM”<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-4.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vsphere-pod-4.png" target="_self">
Kubernetes: Decides which pod should run vSphere: Decides where the pod-VM runs
Enforces CPU, memory, NUMA, HA, DRS This is what “Kubernetes-native mode” really looks like under the hood.From the Pod’s perspective:
It has an IP
It mounts volumes
It exposes ports
Under the hood:
Networking is NSX-backed
Storage is datastore-policy-backed
Attach/detach happens at VM granularity
Again: Pod UX, VM machinery.Despite the VM runtime, vSphere Pods still use:
Pod specs
Containers
Init containers
ConfigMaps
Volume mounts
Pod lifecycle (create/delete/restart)
Kubernetes Services (with some constraints)
So developers mostly don’t care—and that is by design. Regular Pod → process in a shared OS
vSphere Pod → process in its own micro-VM
Or:
Regular K8s → Linux container model
vSphere Pods → “micro-VM container” model
Essentially: vSphere Pods are not regular Kubernetes Pods
They are Pod-shaped workloads backed by per-Pod VMs
Kubernetes API semantics remain intact
Runtime isolation is hypervisor-level

Classic virtualization problem:
Infrastructure admins can ultimately see everything.
vTA introduces cryptographic separation of duties:
Infra admins manage hosts and clusters
They do NOT control keys
Decryption happens only after hardware attestation
This is importan in:
Regulated environments
Confidential Computing
Insider-threat models
Sovereign cloud designs Trust Authority Cluster boots with TPM-backed identity
Hosts and workloads are attested
Only if attestation passes: Encryption keys are released
Protected workloads decrypt and run If trust breaks: Keys are withheld
Workloads remain encrypted / suspended Access to infrastructure ≠ access to data <br>Separate <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> cluster
Minimal admin surface
Hosts key and attestation services Uses CPU security features (e.g., SEV, TDX)
Prevents memory inspection Keys never live with workload admins
Often backed by HSMs
vTA is the strongest isolation boundary in vSphere.Typical usage:
Confidential VMs
Telco and Financial Workloads
Government / Sovereign Clouds
Typical non-usage:
General enterprise clusters
Cost-sensitive environments
Dev/Test
VTA is deliberately heavyweight.You can think of vTA as:
“Even if someone owns the data center, they still cannot read the data.”
It is zero-trust applied to virtualization itself.
❌ Not a secrets manager
❌ Not an identity provider
❌ Not Kubernetes confidential computing (though complementary)
❌ Not required for VCF Strongest insider-threat protection
Hardware-rooted trust
Clear separation of duties Additional clusters and hardware

Limited workload compatibility vSphere Trust Authority brings confidential computing to VCF
It cryptographically separates infra admins from data access

Each CPU socket has: Its own local memory
Faster access to that local memory Accessing memory attached to another socket is slower
non-uniform here does not mean “processes access memory unevenly”; it is from a hardware perspective, and simply means “memory access latency is not the same for all memory locations”Hence: Memory access time is not uniformYou can think of it as:
Two cities (CPU sockets)
Each city has its own warehouse (memory)
Shipping inside the city is fast
Shipping between cities takes longer
NUMA provides massive performance gain if locality is respected.Assume there is a workload that:
Runs on CPU-0

Then, performance will drop due to latency and cache penalties. This is invisible at the OS level unless NUMA-aware.In a NUMA-aware system, CPU threads are scheduled to prefer running on CPUs that are near the memory they already use, not the other way around.
All DRAM is: Equidistant (or close enough)
Reached through a shared memory controller or fabric Differences exist, but: They are not tied to CPU identity
They are mostly hidden from software Software does not (and cannot) reason about “which CPU core owns which memory” From the OS perspective: “Memory is one big pool” Latency variance exists, but not topologically anchored.
In contrast, in NUMA, each CPU socket has its own local memory controller and DRAM; remote memory is reached via an interconnect and is slower.vNUMA is how a hypervisor exposes NUMA topology to a VM.
The VM sees virtual NUMA nodes
Each vNUMA node has: vCPUs
Assigned memory Guest OS can schedule intelligently inside the VM
vNUMA is NUMA-awareness for virtual machinesWithout vNUMA:
Guest OS thinks memory is uniform
Hypervisor silently shuffles memory
Cache locality is lost
With vNUMA:
Guest OS: Allocates memory locally
Schedules threads close to memory Databases, JVMs, etc., perform much better
Tangential (but not directly-related-to) NUMA is SR-IOV.<br><img alt="sriovarchitecture.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/sriovarchitecture.png" target="_self">SR-IOV allows one physical PCIe device (NIC, GPU, HBA) to present:
One Physical Function (PF)
Multiple Virtual Functions (VFs)
The number of VFs an SR-IOV-enabled device can expose is fundamentally limited by the device’s hardware design, firmware, and onboard resources.SR-IOV devices expose a capability like:Total VFs supported: NThis value is:
Burned into silicon
Sometimes further capped by firmware
Sometimes configurable downward (but not upward)
Typical real-world numbers:
8
16
32
64
128
(High-end SmartNICs may go higher)
You cannot exceed this, no matter what the OS or hypervisor wants.Each VF:
Can be assigned directly to a VM
Bypasses the hypervisor datapath
When a VF is assigned:
<br>The VF is bound to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Virtual Machine" data-href="Virtual Machine" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/virtual-machine-primitives/virtual-machine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VM</a>

SR-IOV NIC VF is on NUMA node 1

“How do I deploy and operate a multi-VM application as a single unit?”
Before Kubernetes, before Helm, before Operators—this was VMware’s answer.vApp: OnlineStore
├── Web VM
├── API VM
└── Database VM
You can:
Power on/off the whole application
Clone or export it
Track it as a single object
Critical feature.You can define:
DB starts first
App tier next
Web tier last
Reverse order on shutdown
This was huge in pre-container days.Inside a vApp you can:
Define isolated networks
Connect VMs to internal-only networks
Attach uplinks at the vApp boundary
It is like a “mini datacenter boundary for this application”.vApps support:
OVF / OVA packaging
Application-level metadata
Deployment parameters (IP, hostname, etc.)
This made vApps attractive for:

Kubernetes (pods / guest clusters)
So the formal relationship is:
A Supervisor Cluster is a capability of a vSphere Cluster, not a different cluster type.
But, it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and it surely is a very-sophisticated duck: Operationally, and practically, it is the same thing.<br>A Supervisor Cluster is a Kubernetes control plane that runs on and transforms a <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/inventory-objects/vsphere-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> into a Kubernetes-aware platform.For the ontology-enthusiasts out there:This matters a lot.
vSphere Cluster failure → everything dies

Resource Pools do not add resources — they only slice and prioritize what already exists in the cluster.
Think of a cluster as a water tank:
The tank size = physical host capacity
Resource Pools = valves
Shares = which valve opens wider under pressure
Reservations = minimum guaranteed flow
Limits = maximum allowed flow
No matter how many valves you add, the tank size never changes.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> itself does not require Resource Pools, but they are often used:

Ensure enough spare capacity exists to restart VMs after a failure.
If Admission Control says “no”:
Nothing is broken
You are overcommitted beyond your failure tolerance
This is HA doing its job, not being restrictive.VCF HA is infrastructure HA, not cloud-native app HA.❌ Turning off HA to “fit more VMs”
→ Silent loss of failure guarantees❌ Expecting HA to replace app clustering
→ Wrong layer❌ Confusing HA with zero downtime
→ There is always a restart

It restarts VMs after host failure
It does not provide zero-downtime or app-level resilience

Site failure
Cluster outage
Maintenance windows gone wrong Encrypted VMs
Malicious data corruption
Need for clean rollback instead of “latest replica” Near-zero RPO (seconds)
Change-block tracking
Continuous replication rather than periodic snapshots Automated failover / failback
Application-aware recovery ordering
Network remapping and IP preservation Roll back to a known-good state
Avoid restoring infected replicas
Immutable recovery points (depending on the backing storage) Protect workloads: on-prem → on-prem
on-prem → cloud
cloud → cloud Strong alignment with hybrid VCF deployments
Primarily:
VM workloads

It is not:
A Kubernetes-native backup system
A replacement for application-level backups
A secrets-or-identity-recovery tool
^ all these remain separate concerns.You can think of VCF as enforcing invariants:
“Workloads must be recoverable within defined SLOs.”
VMware Live Recovery is the enforcement mechanism for the resilience invariant:
If a site fails → recover
If data is corrupted → rewind safely
If ransomware hits → recover clean, fast, and confidently
VLR is

Not a backup product
Not a Kubernetes-native DR
Those solve mobility or data protection, not platform-level resilience orchestration.
VMware Live Recovery is VCF’s unified DR + cyber-recovery platform
Designed for low RPO, fast RTO, and clean recovery
Successor mindset to SRM, built for ransomware-era threats

It combines the power of VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) with VCF’s operational tooling to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations.Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.<br>HCX stands for Hybrid Cloud eXtension—it’s not just another name for <a data-href="vMotion" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a>. It’s a comprehensive application mobility platform from VMware that enables workload migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.VCF Operations HCX has the following capabilities:
Seamless workload migration. Migrate VMs and applications in waves live or in bulk with minimal or zero downtime.
Network extension. Extend networks while preserving IP addresses and topologies to maintain application connectivity.
Inter-and intra-VCF mobility. Enable workload mobility within and across multiple&nbsp;VCF instances, including site-to-site and region-to-region migrations.
Application placement optimization. Enables high-performance application mobility across different environments, making it easier to optimize workload placement based on business requirements.
At its heart, VCF Operations HCX is an application mobility platform that:
**Connects environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—with optimized, secure network interconnectivity.
Enables workload migration—live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) and applications between environments with minimal downtime.
Supports hybrid cloud adoption—making it easier to modernize, consolidate, or balance workloads across sites.
Essentially, it extends the capabilities of VCF so that moving workloads into, out of, or around your VCF estate is seamless and automated.VCF Operations HCX automates the process of moving VMs and applications from one environment to another. This includes:
Live migrations (zero or near-zero downtime)
Bulk migrations for large-scale moves
Cross-platform migrations (including non-vSphere sources in some scenarios)
Network extension so IPs/MACs remain consistent during migration
This makes migrations faster, less error-prone, and less disruptive than traditional approaches.HCX builds a secure, encrypted interconnect between sites that:
Extends Layer-2 networks across sites
Preserves VM networking so that workloads keep their addresses
Provides optimized tunnels tailored for high-speed bulk movement
Cloud adoption isn’t a one-time event — usage patterns change. HCX enables:
Moving workloads based on performance needs
Rebalancing for cost or compliance reasons
Continuous optimization of where workloads run
This is key in hybrid environments where business needs or performance requirements evolve over time.VCF Operations HCX has deeper integration with VCF:
Unified management &amp; single sign-on with other VCF components
Shared licensing managed through VCF Operations
Integrated planning &amp; execution workflows with VCF Operations for Networks
Easier deployment with a single unified HCX Manager appliance
That means less separate manual setup and a smoother experience from discovery to execution.Imagine you’re relocating a city’s services (libraries, police stations, hospitals) to a new smart city:
Traditional migration = manually moving each building piece by piece.
VCF Operations HCX = building a dedicated transit corridor where services can shift live without interruption, while preserving all their connections and addresses — all orchestrated by a central operations dashboard instead of manual labor.
<br>vMotion is VMware’s native live-migration technology for moving a running VM between <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> hosts (including memory and CPU state), usually within the same <a data-href="VCF Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/vcf-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Domain</a> or cluster.HCX doesn’t replace vMotion; it leverages it as one migration method (called “HCX vMotion”) when moving workloads between HCX-connected sites. It also supports:
Cold Migration: Powered-off VMs
Bulk Migration: Parallel, batched workloads
Replication-Assisted vMotion: Parallel live migrations via replication + vMotion
So, vMotion is a component inside HCX’s larger orchestration and connectivity framework. VCF Operations HCX is VMware’s integrated workload mobility solution within VMware Cloud Foundation.
It simplifies application migration and workload rebalancing across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
Via optimized network extension and interconnects, it preserves application connectivity and minimizes disruption.
Recent integrations with VCF improve deployment, management, and operational workflows.

This is where actual tenant and workload networking happens.
Implemented using VXLAN
<br>Managed by <a data-href="NSX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX</a>
Provides: Logical switches
Distributed routing
Microsegmentation
NAT, LB, firewalling, etc. VXLAN is used to:
Create L2 networks over L3 infrastructure
Allow massive scale (up to ~16 million segments vs 4096 VLANs)
Decouple network topology from physical constraints
In VCF:
Every workload network = VXLAN-backed logical segment
Encapsulated inside UDP packets
Carried across the underlay VLANs
So effectively:VM / Pod ↓
Logical Switch (VXLAN) ↓
NSX Transport Node ↓
VLAN-backed physical network
Here is a comparison table:Without VLANs:
Every device hears every broadcast
Security boundaries are weak
Networks don’t scale cleanly
With VLANs:
Broadcast traffic is contained
Security and isolation improve
Networks become modular and scalable Each VLAN is identified by a VLAN ID (typically 1–4094)
VLAN ID = logical network identity
Access Port
Carries traffic for one VLAN
Frames are untagged
Typical for end devices (servers, VMs, appliances)
Trunk Port
Carries traffic for multiple VLANs
Frames are tagged with VLAN IDs
Used between switches, hypervisors, routers
On trunk links, Ethernet frames include:
VLAN ID
Priority bits (QoS)
This is how a switch knows which logical network a frame belongs to.One VLAN usually maps to one IP subnet — but they are not the same thing.
Devices in the same VLAN can communicate directly
Devices in different VLANs require a router or L3 switch
This is called inter-VLAN routing
In VMware-based environments:
VLANs are used for underlay networking

It is layered, intentional, and asymmetric.
VCF separates infrastructure tenancy from consumption tenancy.
This is the key to understanding everything else.Where it lives Workload Domains Clusters NSX segments Resource pools Who owns it

Exposes: A database service interface to users
DSM is above infrastructure, below applications.
Provision databases in minutes
Automated: Day-0 setup
Day-1 operations
Day-2 patching and upgrades Consistent configurations every time
No more hand-built “special” DB VMs.
Platform team controls: VM templates
Storage policies

Rewriting everything for Kubernetes
DSM provides the perfect middle ground.
VMware Data Services Manager = DBaaS control plane

It bridges the gap between infrastructure health and actual workload behavior, allowing operators to reason about issues in terms of applications rather than underlying components.At its core, Workload Operations answer:
Is the application running correctly from the user’s point of view—and if not, where is the breakdown?
Workload Operations continuously assess whether applications are functioning as intended.
Tracks <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">workload</a> availability and responsiveness
Monitors performance indicators relevant to application behavior
Detects degradations before they escalate into outages
Distinguishes between infrastructure noise and real workload impact
This ensures operators focus on what matters to consumers, not just raw resource metrics.Beyond infrastructure signals, workload operations account for how applications are perceived by users.
Correlates performance data with service responsiveness
Helps identify issues that are invisible at the host or cluster level
Supports prioritization of incidents based on user impact
Improves alignment between platform teams and application owners
In effect, it reframes operations around service outcomes, not components.<br>For container-based applications, <a data-href="VCF Operations" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/vcf-operations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations</a> provides native awareness of Kubernetes workloads running on the platform.

Monitoring at cluster, namespace, and workload levels
Correlation between container behavior and underlying infrastructure signals
This tight integration eliminates blind spots that traditionally exist between virtualization and Kubernetes operations.By correlating workload-level symptoms with infrastructure-level signals, workload operations significantly shorten troubleshooting cycles.
Rapid isolation of whether issues originate in compute, storage, networking, or the application layer
Reduced hand-offs between infrastructure and platform teams
Faster root-cause identification for mixed VM and container environments
Improved mean time to resolution (MTTR)
Instead of “ping-pong debugging,” operators get end-to-end context.Workload Operations is:
Application-centric rather than component-centric
Equally applicable to VM-based and container-based workloads
Focused on availability, performance, and user impact
Workload Operations is not:
A deployment or CI/CD system
A replacement for application-level instrumentation
A tenant self-service or governance mechanism Workload Operations shift operational focus from infrastructure health to application outcomes
Native integration with Supervisor and VKS enables deep visibility for Kubernetes workloads
Correlated insights reduce troubleshooting time and operational friction
The end goal is reliable applications with predictable user experience, not just healthy infrastructure

Certifacate Challenges:
Certificate sprawl
Expiration risk
Manual rotation = outage risk
VCF Ensures:
Centralized visibility via SDDC Manager
Supported rotation workflows
Integration with enterprise CAs Certificates are fleet-scale secrets, not local files. Appliance passwords
Service accounts
Inter-component credentials
Bootstrap secrets
Reality
Password rotation must be: Coordinated
Non-disruptive
Auditable VCF:
Tracks credentials centrally
Rotates safely
Prevents “unknown admin password” scenarios
This is operational hygiene at scale.
Cluster settings (HA, DRS, admission control)
NSX transport &amp; policies
Storage policies
Network constructs
Domain-level invariants Configuration is declared once and enforced everywhere.
VCF:
Applies opinionated defaults
Detects unsupported deviations
Blocks actions that would break fleet integrity Automation targeting
Chargeback / showback
Compliance classification
Ownership &amp; environment labeling
Tags provide metadata across the entire fleet.
Tags provide horizontal metadata across: Domains
Clusters
VMs
Datastores “The control plane’s labeling system for infrastructure objects.”
Without tags, automation becomes brittle.Fleet Management in VCF

Are my applications getting the resources they expect, and if not—why?
Performance Monitoring collects and analyzes application-level metrics from virtual machines and supporting infrastructure.
CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
Latency, throughput, and contention indicators
Performance baselines derived from historical behavior
Correlation between application performance and infrastructure conditions
This shifts the perspective from “is the host healthy?” to “is the application experiencing friction?”Advanced Analytics and machine learning are applied to identify patterns and anomalies that traditional monitoring often misses.
Detects abnormal behavior relative to learned baselines
Correlates symptoms across compute, storage, and networking layers
Highlights probable root causes rather than isolated alerts
Enables faster time to resolution while avoiding unnecessary overprovisioning
The result is signal over noise, especially in large or dynamic environments.Performance Monitoring ensures workloads maintain reliable access to required resources.
Identifies resource contention and saturation risks
Surfaces inefficient resource usage and imbalance
Supports proactive scaling and right-sizing decisions
Helps balance performance objectives against cost efficiency
This allows operators to protect performance without defaulting to over-allocation.A VCF Operations management pack is a modular integration that extends monitoring and analytics to specific infrastructure or platform components.
Collects metrics, events, and alerts from integrated systems
Normalizes telemetry into a common operational model
Enables deep, component-aware performance analysis
Supports consistent monitoring across heterogeneous environments
Management packs are what allow VCF Operations to scale from generic monitoring into domain-aware performance intelligence.Performance Monitoring is:
Application-aware and infrastructure-correlated
Predictive and analytics-driven
Focused on sustained performance and efficiency
Performance Monitoring is not:
Simple threshold-based alerting
A standalone APM tool
A workload deployment or governance mechanism Performance Monitoring ensures applications continuously receive the resources they need
AI-driven analytics reduce noise and accelerate root-cause analysis
Management packs enable deep, system-specific insights at scale
The goal is sustained performance and cost discipline—not just uptime

Analyzes historical trends to distinguish transient issues from systemic problems
Provides guided troubleshooting workflows and impact analysis
Reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolution (MTTR)
Instead of isolated alerts, diagnostics focus on cause-and-effect relationships.Centralizes and contextualizes logs generated across the VCF stack.
Aggregates logs from infrastructure and platform components
Enables search, filtering, and correlation across time and services
Supports security investigations, audits, and post-incident analysis
Complements metrics-based monitoring with forensic-level visibility
Logs become evidence, not noise.Monitors and analyzes the health, performance, and behavior of networking components.
Tracks latency, packet loss, throughput, and flow patterns
Detects anomalies and deviations from normal traffic behavior
Helps identify bottlenecks, misrouted traffic, and configuration issues
Provides visibility across logical and physical networking layers
This bridges the traditional gap between virtual networking abstractions and real network behavior.Delivers insight into capacity, performance, and reliability of storage resources.

vIDB = the “SSO engine”
VCF SSO = the fleet-level “SSO product experience” that drives vIDB configuration and pushes/coordinates it across components
In real deployments, vIDB is positioned as the central place where you integrate with upstream identity sources (for example AD/LDAPS, or “corporate IdPs” such as Okta/Entra/ADFS), and then VCF components are configured to trust/use that SSO configuration.<br>At a high level, VCF Identity Broker is an identity federation/intermediary service that sits between your enterprise identity provider (e.g., Okta, Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD, Ping Identity, ADFS, LDAP/OpenLDAP) and the VCF platform services (like <a data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter Server</a>, <a data-href="NSX Manager" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx-manager.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX Manager</a>, and the <a data-href="VCF Operations" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/vcf-operations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations</a>/<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> stack).It:
Accepts authentication from an external IdP using modern protocols (e.g., SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect) or directory services (LDAP/AD).
Issues federated/standard tokens to VCF components to enable central SSO across the environment.
Provides user and group provisioning integration (SCIM, Just-In-Time provisioning, LDAP sync) so that IdP users and groups can be mapped into VCF RBAC.
vIDB acts as a universal “identity broker” in a federation chain—it trusts your enterprise IdP and then vouches for those identities to VMware Cloud Foundation services.The vIDB service is described in the field as supporting at least:
Embedded mode (configured inside the management domain’s vCenter context; no separate deployment) <br>Runs inside the <a data-href="Management Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/management-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Management Domain</a>’s <a data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter Server</a> (VCF management cluster).
Easier to deploy, ideal for smaller or single-instance VCF environments.
Doesn’t require a separate appliance. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Virtual Appliance" data-href="Virtual Appliance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/virtual-appliance/virtual-appliance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Appliance</a> mode (a stand-alone vIDB appliance cluster) Deployed as a stand-alone appliance cluster (often a three-node cluster for high availability).

you authenticate once via your enterprise IdP, and VCF Identity Broker handles the rest, issuing tokens and enabling access to all components with a common identity.<br>By centralizing authentication, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> reduces administrative overhead (no separate local accounts to manage on each component) and supports modern enterprise identity standards.VCF Identity Broker supports a range of identity sources:
Modern cloud IdPs: Okta, Ping Identity, Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD, ADFS.
Traditional directory services: Active Directory via LDAP, OpenLDAP. Centralized authentication and SSO—better user experience and reduced login friction.
Integrates with corporate IdPs—enables MFA, policy enforcement, and audit logging from your enterprise identity layer.
Scalable deployment options—embedded for simplicity, appliance for scale/resilience. Adds an additional component to deploy and manage (especially in appliance mode).
Requires careful role mapping and RBAC planning so that IdP groups/roles map correctly to VCF permissions.
Legacy components may not participate in SSO the same way — they might still require local accounts even after VCF Identity Broker is configured.
A very real operational problem in multi-tenant systems is: Users get recreated/reidentified when you switch identity providers (or change claims, subject formats, etc.).
If a tenant starts on IdP-A and later moves to IdP-B, you want a controlled way to preserve user access and authorization mappings.
Remapping is the “bridge” that avoids breaking RBAC simply because the upstream identity changed.
Remapping is usually about reconciling user identities inside the platform’s internal user store / directory representation when the upstream IdP changes. It’s not “magic federation”—it’s an administrative identity-correlation operation.
Upstream IdP (Okta/Entra/ADFS/LDAP-backed federation)
Authenticates the human. Issues identity assertions / tokens.

vIDB is the identity federation service underpinning VCF SSO, aimed at consistent login across VCF components

Key characteristics:
Uses validated upgrade bundles
Enforces component compatibility
Executes sequenced, automated upgrades
Provides rollback and precheck logic
This is not just patching: It is system-level lifecycle orchestration.SDDC Manager is responsible for:
Initial VCF bring-up
Creating: Management Domain

Correct inventory alignment Without SDDC Manager, you do not have VCF: That simple!—You will only have a loosely assembled VMware products.SDDC Manager acts as the system-of-record for:

Their versions
Their relationships
Their lifecycle state

SDDC Manager manages the cloud system itself.SDDC Manager enforces:
Supported topologies
Supported versions
Supported upgrade paths
If you try to:
Upgrade NSX independently
Modify components outside supported flows
You risk breaking VCF supportability.
<br>This is intentional: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> favors predictability over freedom.It is not:

SDDC Manager manages the cloud itself; everything else manages what runs inside that cloud.
Without SDDC Manager:
Enterprises would manually assemble components
Version skew would be common
Upgrades would be risky and expensive
Supportability would collapse
With SDDC Manager:

Lifecycle becomes deterministic
VMware/Broadcom can guarantee outcomes
This is why SDDC Manager is non-optional in VCF.
SDDC Manager is the backbone of VCF
It owns lifecycle, topology, and compatibility
It enforces validated, supported states
It is infrastructure-centric, not tenant-centric
Without it, VCF does not exist as a product

VMware Cloud is how VMware delivers and operates VMware platforms as a service across public, private, and hybrid clouds.
VCF is often the engine; VMware Cloud is the service wrapper.Examples include:
VMware Cloud on AWS
VMware Cloud on Azure
VMware Cloud on Google Cloud
VMware Cloud on OCI
These provide:
Native VMware stacks
Operated as managed services
Tight integration with hyperscaler services
From the customer’s point of view:<br>
“I get <a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a>/<a data-href="NSX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NSX</a>/<a data-href="vSAN" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/vsan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSAN</a> without running the platform myself.”
This is where things look very similar to VCF:
VMware (or a partner) runs VCF on your behalf
Can be hosted: On your premises
In a partner data center You consume it as a cloud service
Regardless of the flavor, VMware Cloud aims to deliver:
Consistent VMware operational model
Reduced platform operational burden
Predictable lifecycle management
Enterprise-grade security and compliance
Hybrid portability (move workloads across clouds)
It is not:
A replacement for Kubernetes-native clouds
A single UI or API
A single SKU
Always customer-operated
It is a portfolio strategy, not a monolith.VMware Cloud = “VMware runs it for you”
VCF = “The platform being run”
vSphere/NSX = “The building blocks”
Or in cloud terms:
VMware Cloud ≈ AWS Managed Services
VCF ≈ AWS internal platform (you don’t see it directly)
vSphere/NSX ≈ EC2 / VPC equivalents Customers want cloud economics
But need enterprise control
And want to reuse VMware skills and tooling
VMware Cloud is VMware’s answer to:
“Give me cloud without forcing me to rewrite everything.” VMware Cloud is a service model, not a product
It spans public, private, and hybrid clouds

A vSphere Appliance is a prepackaged, hardened virtual machine that bundles an OS, application, configuration, and lifecycle tooling into a single deployable unit.A VMware-style appliance typically includes:
>>>>>>> c0778dc (new article)
A minimal, locked-down OS
The application(s)
Configuration defaults
Upgrade mechanisms
Health checks
Backup/restore hooks
Support boundaries (“only change things this way”)
The key idea is:
You manage the appliance as a product, not as a general-purpose OS.
Usually yes, but conceptually they can be:
<br>One VM (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vCenter Server" data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter</a>)
Multiple tightly-coupled VMs (some NSX / telco components)
But still treated as one product unit
From the operator’s perspective:
You deploy “the appliance”
You don’t manage its internals individually
Once you accept that:
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vCenter Server" data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter</a> is a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Virtual Machine" data-href="Virtual Machine" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/virtual-machine-primitives/virtual-machine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VM</a>

VCF-A governance is front-door, human-aware, policy-driven
It’s about entitlement, approval, and lifecycle
It is not a security monitoring system
It is not a Terraform-style reconciler
It is exactly what service providers and large enterprises need to avoid chaos
What Governance is NOT:Governance does not watch workloads.
It decides whether they are allowed to exist in the first place.Governance (VCF Automation)

Nothing in the execution layer knowns governance exists.
Governance defines who may open the door.
Execution decides what happens after they are inside the house.
In other words, governance is “pre-creation” control, not runtime policing.<br>From here, <a data-href="Policy" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/policy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Policy</a>, <a data-href="Policy as Code" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/policy-as-code.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Policy as Code</a>, and <a data-href="STIG" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/stig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">STIG</a> are all good candidates to check out.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Concepts/Governance and Compliance/Governance.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 22:19:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Management Domain]]></title><description><![CDATA[![[workload-domain-b8d5ddd7-899b-4c34-8947-4acbd57f8f72.webp]The Management Domain is created during the deployment or convergence process by the&nbsp;<a data-href="VCF Installer" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vcf-enablers/vcf-installer/vcf-installer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Installer</a>.

Deployments
Examples:

Which regions, clusters, or storage types are allowed
Maximum CPU / memory / cost
Required approvals before deployment
Policies are:
Evaluated before provisioning
Enforced during lifecycle actions
Stored and versioned

Enforced as admission controls
Prevent non-compliant workloads from being created
Examples:
Pods must not run as root
Images must come from approved registries
Network policies are mandatory
Resource limits must be defined
This is PaC in its purest form: Declarative rules evaluated at runtime.VCF PaC complements Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines:
Policies validate IaC plans before apply
Prevent drift and unsafe configurations
Align infra provisioning with governance rules Who can deploy
Where they can deploy
What resources they can consume Encryption requirements
Network isolation
Image provenance
<br><a data-href="STIG" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/stig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">STIG</a> / CIS alignment Resource quotas
Budget limits
Placement constraints Approval Workflows
Lease durations
Auto-decommission rules
Without Policy as Code
“Please remember not to deploy large VMs in prod.”
With Policy as Code
“Deployments violating this rule are automatically rejected.”
PaC the difference between:
Guidelines vs guarantees
Human memory vs machine enforcement
Audit after the fact vs prevention by design
<br>From VMware’s perspective, PaC is critical because <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> serves:

Governance defines who may open the door.
Execution decides what happens after they are inside the house.

Fleet → Multiple clusters managed centrally
Instance → One cluster + control plane
Domain → Node pools / system vs workload separation

Different teams
Different applications
Different environments (prod, staging, dev)
Each project is isolated from others by policy.Projects define who can do what:

Which Cloud Zones they can use
Resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage)
Network constraints
Storage policies
This prevents a single tenant from exhausting shared infrastructure.Projects are the context in which users deploy:

A set of Kubernetes namespaces inside those clusters

<br>In <a data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VMware Cloud Foundation</a>, the terms template and blueprint are related but not interchangeable. They operate at different abstraction layers and serve different purposes in the lifecycle of infrastructure and workloads.
A template defines what a single resource looks like.
A blueprint defines how multiple resources come together.
A template is a reusable, preconfigured artifact that represents one resource, typically:
VM Template A golden VM image (OS + patches + base software)
Used to rapidly deploy identical VMs OVF/OVA Templates <br>Portable packaged <a data-href="Virtual Appliance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/virtual-appliance/virtual-appliance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Virtual Appliance</a>s Content Library Templates <br>Shared across <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vCenter Server" data-href="vCenter Server" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/vcenter-server.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vCenter</a> instances and <a data-href="VCF Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/vcf-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Domain</a>s Infrastructure-level
Static
Low abstraction
No logic, no dependencies
Consumed by automation tools (not orchestrating anything themselves)
A Template says:
“This is what a machine looks like when it’s born.”
In contrast, a single Blueprint can define these following components:
2 application VMs
1 database VM
A load balancer
A network segment
Placement rules
Lifecycle actions
That entire topology is deployed as one logical unit.
Blueprints consume templates.
Here is possible flow:
Template: Ubuntu 22.04 VM with hardened baseline Blueprint: Uses that template
Defines how many instances
Attaches networks
Applies policies
Adds lifecycle logic So:
Templates = building blocks
Blueprints = architectural plans
In Kubernetes terms (for intuition):
Template ≈ Container Image
Blueprint ≈ Helm Chart / Application Manifest
Understanding this distinction prevents common mistakes:
❌ Treating templates as reusable environments
❌ Expecting templates to handle lifecycle logic
❌ Trying to encode business logic inside VM images
Correct mental model:
Templates are static
Blueprints are dynamic and declarative
As a quick comparison:
Template
→ A reusable VM or image
→ Low-level, static, infrastructure-focused
Blueprint
→ A declarative application/environment definition
→ High-level, orchestrated, lifecycle-aware

VCF Edge brings “the VCF way” to thousands of small, remote sites—without turning each site into a snowflake.
<br><img alt="VCF-Edge-1 1.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-edge-1-1.png" target="_self">Edge sites typically have constraints that central data centers do not:
Small host counts (often 2–4 nodes)
Limited on-site staff (or none)
Intermittent or high-latency connectivity (an edge-site not having Internet connectivity for a month is not uncommon)
Strict uptime requirements
Local data-residency or latency needs
VCF Edge is about operating under those constraints without abandoning platform discipline.<br>However, even at the edge, the core <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> principles remain:
Centralized lifecycle control
Validated configurations
Strong isolation and security
Declarative operations
Consistent operational model
What changes is scale, footprint, and placement—not the philosophy.Central / Regional Site
├── Management Domain (SDDC Manager, vCenter, NSX)
├── Automation &amp; Ops
│
└── Edge Sites (many) ├── Small Workload Domain (or cluster) ├── Local workloads (VMs / K8s) ├── Local networking &amp; security └── Centrally managed lifecycle
So:
While, management stays centralized
execution happens at the edge
Depending on use case:
Telco workloads (RAN, core, MEC)
Retail store systems
Factory / OT workloads
Branch office services
Latency-sensitive apps
These workloads:
Run locally
Are managed remotely

Platform admins operate from a hub
Edge sites follow validated patterns Workloads keep running if disconnected
Local failover is possible
Management resumes when connectivity returns
This balance is critical for an edge site.VCF Edge supports:

Physical isolation per tenant is less common at edge
Operational simplicity is prioritized
Edge is where: Hyperscalers struggle with footprint and latency Enterprises need consistency across thousands of sites Telco and regulated industries dominate Unlike a traditional cloud or data center (where workloads are centralized to regions), edge is decentralized, and geographically spread. This is topologically opposite to a typical cloud deployment. <br>

Every workload network = VXLAN-backed logical segment
Encapsulated inside UDP packets
Carried across the underlay VLANs
So effectively:VM / Pod ↓
Logical Switch (VXLAN) ↓
NSX Transport Node ↓
VLAN-backed physical network
Here is a comparison table:Without VLANs:
Every device hears every broadcast
Security boundaries are weak
Networks don’t scale cleanly
With VLANs:
Broadcast traffic is contained
Security and isolation improve
Networks become modular and scalable Each VLAN is identified by a VLAN ID (typically 1–4094)
VLAN ID = logical network identity
Access Port
Carries traffic for one VLAN
Frames are untagged
Typical for end devices (servers, VMs, appliances)
Trunk Port
Carries traffic for multiple VLANs
Frames are tagged with VLAN IDs
Used between switches, hypervisors, routers
On trunk links, Ethernet frames include:
VLAN ID
Priority bits (QoS)
This is how a switch knows which logical network a frame belongs to.One VLAN usually maps to one IP subnet — but they are not the same thing.
Devices in the same VLAN can communicate directly
Devices in different VLANs require a router or L3 switch
This is called inter-VLAN routing
In VMware-based environments:
VLANs are used for underlay networking

Those are implementation details.VCF asks only:
Where does it run?
Who owns it?
What resources does it consume?

If VCF tried to manage each kind of workload differently, it would:
explode in complexity
duplicate logic
couple business policy to runtime mechanics
So instead, VCF defines:
Workload = Policy + Placement + Lifecycle + Resources
Everything else is delegated downward.All of the following are equally valid workloads in VCF:VCF deliberately does not rank or privilege any of these.In VCF, a workload is anything that consumes platform resources and is subject to platform policy—its internal shape is intentionally irrelevant.
VCF intentionally erases runtime distinctions

The kind or form of the workload becomes irrelevant.VCF does NOT care:
whether the workload uses containerd or not
<br>whether it’s a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="vSphere Pod" data-href="vSphere Pod" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/architecture-and-core-concepts/vsphere-pod.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PodVM</a> or classic VM
whether it runs Go, Java, or Bash
whether it was deployed via Helm, kubectl, or Terraform
whether it is “cloud-native” or “legacy”
Those are runtime-layer concerns, not platform-layer concerns.
A power grid doesn’t care if you plug in a toaster or a server rack—only how much power you draw and what safety rules apply.
This is why statements like these are true:
“Pod workloads are not special.”
“VM workloads are not special.”
“Guest clusters are just workloads.”
“Infrastructure doesn’t care about your app model.”
So, you don’t fight against the platform to fit the workload in; you design the workload to fit the platform’s (opinionated) invariants.To internalize VCF, don’t think in:
Pods vs VMs
Containers vs Processes
Control Planes vs Data Planes
<br>Instead, think in <a data-href="Governance" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Governance</a>:
Who owns this?

This is where theory meets entropy: failures happen, usage grows, humans make mistakes, and the platform must keep working anyway.If:
Day 0 pours the concrete
Day 1 frames the building
Day 2 is living in it for years
Or:
Day 0 → Existence
Day 1 → Enablement
Day 2 → Sustainment
Day 2 is continuous, not a phase you “finish”.This is the obvious part—but it’s only the surface.
Deploy workloads (VMs, Pods, clusters)
Scale up/down
Start / stop / suspend
Migrate workloads
Retire workloads
Day 2 starts the feedback loop.

Workload Clusters run applications; Management Clusters run the cloud.

Just virtualization

A UI

It is the system-level design philosophy that VCF enforces.VCF’s value proposition is:
“You don’t assemble an SDDC yourself anymore: We ship one.”
That’s why:
VCF has strict BOMs
VCF enforces lifecycle orchestration
VCF tightly integrates ops + automation + infra
This is intentional: freedom at the top, rigidity at the bottom.
SDDC = architecture
VCF = implementation of that architecture
In VCF, everything (compute, storage, network, ops) is software-defined
SDDC enables cloud-like behavior on private infrastructure
You deploy VCF, and you get an SDDC: That simple.

There is no separate tenant object inside Kubernetes.
<br>A <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> is the tenant boundary at the vSphere-Kubernetes interface.
If you assume:
Tenant = Project → you’ll design the wrong thing
Tenant = Kubernetes namespace → you’ll under-secure
Tenant = Supervisor Namespace → things line up
“tenant namespace” is an informal shorthand for supervisor namespace. Organizations and Projects are governance overlays. They do not define the tenant.Kubernetes namespaces inside guest clusters are secondary scopes.<br>In <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> each tenant is realized as one (or more) <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s.<br>
<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> sits above, provides governance (Organizations, Projects, quotas) and self-service, but does not define tenancy by itself.This is sometimes “informally” expressed as “tenant namespaces”. What is meant by it is a Supervisor Namespace.Or more precisely: In a Supervisor Cluster tenant == supervisor namespace (there is a 1-1 relationship).<br>In vSphere Supervisor, tenancy is realized through <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s, which serve as the execution and isolation boundary for tenants.When people say:
“tenant namespace”
“project namespace”
“customer namespace”
They almost always mean: A Supervisor Namespace allocated to that tenant. Kubernetes does not have a separate construct for this: It is a vSphere concept, projected as a namespace.A Supervisor Namespace can contain:
Pods
VMs
Entire guest Kubernetes clusters

└── Supervisor Namespace ├── VM workloads ├── Pod workloads └── Guest K8s Cluster └── many Kubernetes namespaces

└── vSphere (vCenter) └── Supervisor Cluster └── Supervisor Namespace ← TENANT BOUNDARY
At this layer:

Storage policies
Network segments
RBAC bindings Is created and owned by vCenter
Maps to: Resource pools

VCF Environment (Rackspace)
└── Supervisor Cluster ├── ns-cocacola ← Tenant: Coca-Cola ├── ns-pepsi ← Tenant: Pepsi └── ns-pizzahut ← Tenant: Pizza Hut
Each tenant is a supervisor namespace.<br><img alt="Supervisor-Namespace.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/supervisor-namespace.png" target="_self">For Coca-Cola (example):
Fixed CPU / memory quota
Dedicated or isolated NSX segment
Approved storage policies
RBAC scoped to Coca-Cola admins
Ability to run: Pods
VMs
Guest Kubernetes clusters
That namespace is the tenant boundary. Layer VCF automation on top of this:Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke-Prod └── Deployments → targets ns-cocacola Organization: Pepsi
└── Project: Pepsi-Shared └── Deployments → targets ns-pepsi
Organizations and Projects map to Supervisor Namespaces — they do not replace them.Automation gives:
Self-service catalogs
Approval workflows
Policy as code
Lifecycle orchestration
But the tenant still “lives” at the Supervisor Namespace.Scope
vCenter
Supervisor Cluster
NSX
Storage policies
Responsibilities
Create Supervisor Namespaces
Set quotas
Attach networks
Bind tenant identities
Enforce platform guardrails
Power level
God-mode
Not visible to customers
Scope
One Supervisor Namespace (e.g., ns-cocacola)
Kubernetes API within that namespace
Responsibilities
Manage workloads
Deploy guest clusters
Configure service
Delegate access internally
Cannot
See other tenants
Modify quotas
Escape namespace
This is who you hand the kubeconfig to.
Scope
Kubernetes RBAC inside tenant (supervisor) namespace
Possibly inside guest clusters
Responsibilities
Deploy apps
Manage services
Consume secrets
No infrastructure privileges
Scope
Automation policies
Catalogs
Projects
Approvals
This role:
Often held by Rackspace
Sometimes delegated partially to tenants
<br><a href="./https://vcf.wtf?query=tag:secrets" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#secrets">#secrets</a>
Secrets do not cross Supervisor Namespaces
Identity trust roots often terminate there
Network policy enforcement happens there
Audit logs are scoped there
So when you say tenant == Supervisor Namespace,
then:
Security
Compliance
Billing
Automation
all align clearly.

Project Administrators manage:
Project users and access
Workload provisioning (VMs, Kubernetes clusters, services)
Project-scoped quotas and approvals
Day-to-day operational policies
Their authority is strictly bounded by:

Platform-defined constraints
Without this separation:
Tenants could break upgrade paths
Platform consistency would erode
Supportability would collapse
One tenant could impact others
VCF deliberately trades tenant flexibility for platform predictability, safety, and lifecycle integrity.
Organization Administrator is the true tenant administrator in VCF 9
Project Administrator governs consumption within a tenant
The separation protects multi-tenancy, lifecycle management, and supportability
This boundary is foundational to VCF’s architecture

Validates configuration consistency against VMware best practices
Detects drift, misconfigurations, and version incompatibilities
Surfaces health scores and risk indicators at fleet, domain, and component levels
Helps operators move from reactive firefighting to preventive maintenance
This provides a continuous “wellness check” for the entire VCF environment.Enables rapid root-cause analysis when issues arise.
Correlates symptoms across compute, storage, and networking layers
Analyzes historical trends to distinguish transient issues from systemic problems
Provides guided troubleshooting workflows and impact analysis
Reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolution (MTTR)
Instead of isolated alerts, diagnostics focus on cause-and-effect relationships.Centralizes and contextualizes logs generated across the VCF stack.
Aggregates logs from infrastructure and platform components
Enables search, filtering, and correlation across time and services
Supports security investigations, audits, and post-incident analysis
Complements metrics-based monitoring with forensic-level visibility
Logs become evidence, not noise.Monitors and analyzes the health, performance, and behavior of networking components.
Tracks latency, packet loss, throughput, and flow patterns
Detects anomalies and deviations from normal traffic behavior
Helps identify bottlenecks, misrouted traffic, and configuration issues
Provides visibility across logical and physical networking layers
This bridges the traditional gap between virtual networking abstractions and real network behavior.Delivers insight into capacity, performance, and reliability of storage resources.
Monitors IOPS, latency, throughput, and utilization trends
Predicts capacity exhaustion and performance degradation
Identifies imbalanced workloads and storage hotspots
Supports informed decisions around scaling and optimization
Storage operations turn capacity planning from guesswork into data-driven forecasting.VCF Operations is:
Observability and operational intelligence
Predictive and preventive rather than purely reactive
Focused on platform behavior and risk
VCF Operations is not:
A workload deployment or provisioning system
A policy enforcement or approval engine
A tenant-facing self-service layer VCF Operations is the operational nervous system of VCF
It emphasizes insight, correlation, and prediction—not just monitoring
It complements VCF Automation by ensuring the platform remains healthy, performant, and secure over time
Its value compounds as environments scale and diversify

It is not:
A Kubernetes-native backup system
A replacement for application-level backups

^ all these remain separate concerns.You can think of VCF as enforcing invariants:
“Workloads must be recoverable within defined SLOs.”
VMware Live Recovery is the enforcement mechanism for the resilience invariant:
If a site fails → recover
If data is corrupted → rewind safely
If ransomware hits → recover clean, fast, and confidently

It combines the power of VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) with VCF’s operational tooling to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations.Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.<br>HCX stands for Hybrid Cloud eXtension—it’s not just another name for <a data-href="vMotion" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a>. It’s a comprehensive application mobility platform from VMware that enables workload migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.VCF Operations HCX has the following capabilities:
Seamless workload migration. Migrate VMs and applications in waves live or in bulk with minimal or zero downtime.
Network extension. Extend networks while preserving IP addresses and topologies to maintain application connectivity.
Inter-and intra-VCF mobility. Enable workload mobility within and across multiple&nbsp;VCF instances, including site-to-site and region-to-region migrations.
Application placement optimization. Enables high-performance application mobility across different environments, making it easier to optimize workload placement based on business requirements.
At its heart, VCF Operations HCX is an application mobility platform that:
**Connects environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—with optimized, secure network interconnectivity.
Enables workload migration—live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) and applications between environments with minimal downtime.
Supports hybrid cloud adoption—making it easier to modernize, consolidate, or balance workloads across sites.
Essentially, it extends the capabilities of VCF so that moving workloads into, out of, or around your VCF estate is seamless and automated.VCF Operations HCX automates the process of moving VMs and applications from one environment to another. This includes:
Live migrations (zero or near-zero downtime)
Bulk migrations for large-scale moves
Cross-platform migrations (including non-vSphere sources in some scenarios)
Network extension so IPs/MACs remain consistent during migration
This makes migrations faster, less error-prone, and less disruptive than traditional approaches.HCX builds a secure, encrypted interconnect between sites that:
Extends Layer-2 networks across sites
Preserves VM networking so that workloads keep their addresses
Provides optimized tunnels tailored for high-speed bulk movement
Cloud adoption isn’t a one-time event — usage patterns change. HCX enables:
Moving workloads based on performance needs
Rebalancing for cost or compliance reasons
Continuous optimization of where workloads run
This is key in hybrid environments where business needs or performance requirements evolve over time.VCF Operations HCX has deeper integration with VCF:
Unified management &amp; single sign-on with other VCF components
Shared licensing managed through VCF Operations
Integrated planning &amp; execution workflows with VCF Operations for Networks
Easier deployment with a single unified HCX Manager appliance
That means less separate manual setup and a smoother experience from discovery to execution.Imagine you’re relocating a city’s services (libraries, police stations, hospitals) to a new smart city:
Traditional migration = manually moving each building piece by piece.
VCF Operations HCX = building a dedicated transit corridor where services can shift live without interruption, while preserving all their connections and addresses — all orchestrated by a central operations dashboard instead of manual labor.
<br>vMotion is VMware’s native live-migration technology for moving a running VM between <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> hosts (including memory and CPU state), usually within the same <a data-href="VCF Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/vcf-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Domain</a> or cluster.HCX doesn’t replace vMotion; it leverages it as one migration method (called “HCX vMotion”) when moving workloads between HCX-connected sites. It also supports:
Cold Migration: Powered-off VMs
Bulk Migration: Parallel, batched workloads
Replication-Assisted vMotion: Parallel live migrations via replication + vMotion
So, vMotion is a component inside HCX’s larger orchestration and connectivity framework. VCF Operations HCX is VMware’s integrated workload mobility solution within VMware Cloud Foundation.
It simplifies application migration and workload rebalancing across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
Via optimized network extension and interconnects, it preserves application connectivity and minimizes disruption.
Recent integrations with VCF improve deployment, management, and operational workflows.

An input parameter is an argument that the workflow processes when it runs. The user, an application, another workflow, or an action passes input parameters to a workflow for the workflow to process when it runs.For example, if a workflow resets a virtual machine, the workflow requires the name of the virtual machine as an input parameter.A workflow's output parameters represent the result from the workflow run. Output parameters can change when a workflow or a workflow element runs. During a workflow run, the workflow can receive the output parameters of other workflows as input parameters.For example, if a workflow creates a snapshot of a virtual machine, the output parameter for the workflow is the resulting snapshot.Workflow elements process data that they receive as input parameters, and set the resulting data as workflow variables or output parameters.Read-only workflow variables act as global constants for a workflow. Writable variables act as a workflow’s global variables.You can use variables to transfer data between the elements of a workflow.You can obtain variables in the following ways:
Define variables when you create a workflow.
Set the output parameter of a workflow element as a workflow variable.
Inherit variables from a configuration element.
A workflow schema is a graphical representation that shows the workflow as a flow diagram of interconnected workflow elements. The workflow schema is the most important element of a workflow as it determines its logic.When users run a workflow, they provide the values for the input parameters of the workflow in the workflow presentation.A workflow token represents a workflow that is running or has finished running.A workflow is an abstract description of a process that defines a generic sequence of steps and a generic set of required input parameters. When you run a workflow with a set of input parameters, you receive an instance of this abstract workflow that behaves according to the specific input parameters you give it. This specific instance of a finished or a running workflow is called a workflow token.Workflow Token Attributes are the specific parameters with which a workflow token runs.The workflow token attributes are an aggregation of the workflow's global variables and the specific input and output parameters with which you run the workflow token.<br>Next, you might want to look into <a data-href="Running VCF Operations Orchestrator Workflows" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/running-vcf-operations-orchestrator-workflows.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Running VCF Operations Orchestrator Workflows</a>, or you can check out <a data-href="VCF Operations Orchestrator" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/vcf-operations-orchestrator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations Orchestrator</a>.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/workflow.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Workflow Management/Workflow.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[workflow-1]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Assets/workflow-1.png</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:46:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IaaS]]></title><description><![CDATA[IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a cloud computing model where you rent fundamental IT infrastructure—instead of owning and managing physical hardware.IaaS provides fundamental computing resources where the consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.In plain terms:
IaaS = someone else runs the data center; you control the machines.
The cloud provider gives you raw building blocks:
Compute → virtual machines (VMs)
Storage → block, object, file storage
Networking → virtual networks, IPs, load balancers, firewalls
You decide:
Which OS to run
How to configure the machine
What software to install
How to secure and scale it
Analogy:
Owning hardware → buying a house
IaaS → renting an empty apartment (walls and plumbing are there; furniture and rules are up to you) Amazon Web Services → EC2
Microsoft Azure → Virtual Machines
Google Cloud → Compute Engine
All of these give you VMs, networks, and storage—but no application opinion.Example:
IaaS → “Give me a Linux box”
PaaS → “Run my app”
SaaS → “Just let me use the app” Maximum control and flexibility
Works for legacy apps
Fine-grained networking &amp; security

It hosts the management plane—the services that build, operate, upgrade, and secure the rest of the cloud.Put simply:
If the Management Cluster is down, you can’t manage the cloud—only the workloads keep running.
<br>The Management Cluster is part of the <a data-href="Management Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/management-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Management Domain</a> (a special Workload Domain).

These components do not belong to the tenants. They belong to the platform.It runs the services that:
Define topology
Enforce lifecycle sequencing
Validate upgrades
Maintain inventory and state
All VCF lifecycle operations (create domain, expand cluster, upgrade stack) are coordinated from here.Tenant workloads do not run here (by design):
No tenant VMs
No tenant Kubernetes workloads
No customer apps
This protects:
Stability
Security
Upgrade safety
It is not:
A tenant cluster
A workload execution environment
A shared resource pool for apps
Optional or replaceable
Treating it like a general-purpose cluster is a serious anti-pattern.This separation ensures:
Predictable upgrades (no tenant interference)
Clear blast-radius control
Strong security boundaries
Operational sanity at scale
It’s the same pattern used by:
Kubernetes (control plane vs worker nodes)
Public clouds (provider plane vs customer plane) Management Cluster → Kubernetes control plane nodes
Guest Clusters → Kubernetes worker nodes
SDDC Manager → Cluster lifecycle operator
You wouldn’t run apps on the Kubernetes control plane; same rule applies here.
Management Cluster is typically: Small (minimum viable size)
Highly available
Strictly protected If it fails: Existing workloads keep running
You lose management, scaling, and upgrades until restored The Management Cluster runs the cloud, not the workloads

Performance-sensitive vs general A VCF Domain is to VCF what a Kubernetes cluster is to Kubernetes-based platforms.It gives you:
Failure domain isolation
Security boundary
Upgrade blast-radius control
Operational independence

IaaS = someone else runs the data center; you control the machines.
The cloud provider gives you raw building blocks:
Compute → virtual machines (VMs)
Storage → block, object, file storage
Networking → virtual networks, IPs, load balancers, firewalls
You decide:
Which OS to run
How to configure the machine
What software to install
How to secure and scale it
Analogy:
Owning hardware → buying a house
IaaS → renting an empty apartment (walls and plumbing are there; furniture and rules are up to you) Amazon Web Services → EC2
Microsoft Azure → Virtual Machines
Google Cloud → Compute Engine
All of these give you VMs, networks, and storage—but no application opinion.Example:
IaaS → “Give me a Linux box”
PaaS → “Run my app”
SaaS → “Just let me use the app” Maximum control and flexibility
Works for legacy apps
Fine-grained networking &amp; security
Familiar mental model for infra engineers You manage OS patching and security
Higher operational burden
Easier to misconfigure
Less opinionated guardrails <br><a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a>-style VM workloads map very naturally to IaaS

SDDC Manager APIs → Build and maintain the cloud

These are both human and also script friendly.Used for:
Diagnostics
Operational workflows
Automation-friendly scripting
Break-glass scenarios
It is a thin wrapper over SDDC Manager APIs, with guardrails.This is:
A faster iteration than REST during ops
An easier integration into shell scripts
Provides consistent auth and context handling
CLIs are not separate systems — they are API clients.These are language bindings.Where available, VMware/Broadcom provides SDKs that wrap REST APIs in native language constructs:
Object models
Typed requests/responses
Auth helpers
Pagination, retries, error handling
These SDKs are ideal when:
You are building a platform or product
You need maintainable, testable code

VCF Installer steps out of the picture
You can think of it as:
VCF Installer creates SDDC Manager; SDDC Manager creates and manages everything else.
A natural question is: “Why not just use SDDC Manager from the start?”Because:
SDDC Manager itself must be deployed
That deployment requires validated sequencing
That sequencing must run before SDDC Manager exists

Depending on the type of workflow that you are developing, you might follow a different sequence of step or skip a step. For example, you can create a workflow without custom scripting.Generally, developing a workflow involves the following steps. Create a new workflow or create a duplicate of an existing workflow from the standard library. Provide general information about the workflow. Define the input and output parameters of the workflow. Lay out and link the workflow schema to define the logical flow of the workflow. Bind the input and output parameters of each schema element to workflow variables. Write the necessary scripts for scriptable task elements or custom decision elements. Create the workflow presentation from the&nbsp; Input Form &nbsp;tab. Validate the workflow. Practices for developing workflowsYou can follow best practices for developing Orchestrator workflows by multiple users and in a clustered environment. Each developer has a dedicated test standalone Orchestrator instance for creating and developing workflows. As VCF Automation can only have single Orchestrator instance integrated to it, this should be a separate standalone instance. Workflows are saved as maven projects on a shared source code control system. To ensure optimal performance of the Orchestrator production deployment, it is best to import workflows in a scheduled period. Working with the workflow editorYou create and edit workflows in the Orchestrator workflow editor. The workflow editor is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;for developing workflows.The workflow editor consists of tabs where you edit the components of your workflows. Summary. Provide general information about the workflow, such as the workflow name, description, tags, and version number. The Summary tab can also be used to configure the server restart behavior and workflow run failure behavior. Variables. Define the variables for your workflow. Variables were previously known as attributes. Input/Output. Define the input and output parameters of your workflow. The input parameters provide the data that the workflow processes during the workflow run. The output parameters are provided when the workflow run finishes. Schema. Build your workflow by dragging workflow schema elements from the workflow palette on the left side of the Schema tab. By clicking an element in the schema diagram, you can define and edit the element's behavior. Input Form. Define the layout of the user input dialog box that appears when users run a workflow. You arrange the parameters and variables into presentation steps and tabs to ease identification of parameters in the input parameters dialog box. You define the constraints on the input parameters that users can provide in the presentation by setting the parameter properties. You can also add external validation for your workflow by using actions. Version History. View and manage the version history of the workflow. Compare and restore versions and push and pull workflows to and from your integrated Git repository. Audit. View information about events related to the workflow such as, when it was saved, when a workflow run was performed, and when a workflow run was finished. ]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/developing-workflows-with-vcf-operations-orchestrator.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Workflow Management/Developing Workflows with VCF Operations Orchestrator.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:59:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[vCloud Director]]></title><description><![CDATA[VMware vCloud Director (VCD) is a cloud-management and multi-tenancy layer built on top of <a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a>.

It hosts the management plane—the services that build, operate, upgrade, and secure the rest of the cloud.Put simply:
If the Management Cluster is down, you can’t manage the cloud—only the workloads keep running.
The Management Cluster is part of the Management Domain (a special Workload Domain).
It is created first during Day-0 bring-up and is non-optional.Typical components include: SDDC Manager vCenter Server (management vCenter) NSX Managers vSAN management services Optional: Operations / Automation services (depending on deployment) These components do not belong to tenants. They belong to the platform.It runs the services that: Define topology Enforce lifecycle sequencing Validate upgrades Maintain inventory and state All VCF lifecycle operations (create domain, expand cluster, upgrade stack) are coordinated from here.Tenant workloads do not run here (by design): No tenant VMs No tenant Kubernetes workloads No customer apps This protects: Stability Security Upgrade safety It is not: A tenant cluster A workload execution environment A shared resource pool for apps Optional or replaceable Treating it like a general-purpose cluster is a serious anti-pattern.This separation ensures: Predictable upgrades (no tenant interference) Clear blast-radius control Strong security boundaries Operational sanity at scale It’s the same pattern used by: Kubernetes (control plane vs worker nodes) Public clouds (provider plane vs customer plane) Management Cluster → Kubernetes control plane nodes Workload Clusters → Kubernetes worker nodes SDDC Manager → Cluster lifecycle operator You wouldn’t run apps on the Kubernetes control plane; same rule applies here. Management Cluster is typically: Small (minimum viable size) Highly available Strictly protected If it fails: Existing workloads keep running You lose management, scaling, and upgrades until restored The Management Cluster runs the cloud, not the workloads It is part of the Management Domain It hosts SDDC Manager, vCenter, NSX Managers It is isolated, mandatory, and high-blast-radius Treat it as sacred infrastructure If you want, next we can: Compare Management Cluster vs Supervisor Cluster Walk through failure scenarios and recovery Discuss why tenants should never land here Map this to VCF Day-0 / Day-1 / Day-2 flows ]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/management-cluster.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Concepts/Design and Abstractions/Architectural Constructs/VCF Topology/Management Cluster.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:24:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2019/09/1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2019/09/1.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Platform Admin]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Image" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-9.50.30-AM.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/a97cd01f-78bd-4c75-9033-bf9cbb5aa51c.original.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2021/03/Viewer_Role_Assigned-1024x352.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://vmtechie.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png?w=1024" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">In VMware Cloud Foundation, a Platform Admin is the role responsible for building, operating, and protecting the cloud platform itself, whereas a Tenant Admin operates within the boundaries that the platform defines.The distinction is intentional and fundamental.
Platform Admins manage the cloud; Tenant Admins manage what runs on the cloud.
Platform Admins control: VCF bring-up and expansion Workload Domains (create, expand, retire) Cluster topology Host add/remove End-to-end upgrades (ESXi, vCenter, NSX, vSAN) Version compatibility and validation This authority is exercised primarily via SDDC Manager.Platform Admins define and enforce: Supported topologies Approved upgrade paths Networking architecture (NSX fabrics, segments) Certificate and trust boundaries Global availability and DR patterns They prevent configuration drift and unsupported states.Platform Admins own: Physical and virtual isolation boundaries Network micro-segmentation at fabric level Root trust (certificates, identity backends) Auditability and compliance posture They decide what is possible, not just what is allowed.Platform Admins can: Enable multi-tenancy Define Organizations Set global quotas and policies Choose which services are exposed to tenants But they do not day-to-day operate tenant workloads.Tenant Admins operate inside the sandbox provided by the platform: Organization- or Project-scoped administration User and role management (within tenant) Quotas and approvals (within limits) Workload provisioning (VMs, Kubernetes, services) Policies related to consumption They cannot: Change platform topology Upgrade core infrastructure Bypass platform validation Affect other tenants Without this separation: Tenants could break upgrade paths Platform consistency would collapse Supportability would be impossible One tenant could affect another VCF deliberately trades flexibility for predictability and safety at the platform layer.Think of a public cloud provider: AWS/Azure Platform Team → Platform Admin Your AWS Account Admin → Tenant Admin You can do a lot in your account —
but you cannot upgrade AWS itself.That boundary is exactly what VCF recreates on-prem.A Platform Admin is not: A super tenant A convenience role Just “another admin with more permissions” It is a different class of responsibility with structural authority.Platform Admins are expected to: Understand deep system interactions Respect lifecycle invariants Make decisions with global blast radius Prioritize stability over local optimization In most enterprises, there should be very few of them. Platform Admins own the cloud itself Tenant Admins own consumption within it The split protects multi-tenancy, upgrades, and supportability Platform Admin ≠ “stronger tenant admin” This separation is foundational to VCF’s design If you want, next we can: Map exact VCF roles to Platform vs Tenant Admin Walk through a real workflow showing the handoff Identify anti-patterns where this boundary is violated ]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/tenancy-in-vcf/platform-admin.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Concepts/Tenancy in VCF/Platform Admin.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-9.50.30-AM.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-9.50.30-AM.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tenant Admin]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Image" src="https://www.cloud13.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vRealize-Automation-Enterprise-VPC.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://vmtechie.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png?w=1024" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/7-0/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/f65e8ece-4543-4e7a-a658-b65f724fdd0f.original.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">In VMware Cloud Foundation, multi-tenancy is the ability to securely host multiple independent consumers (tenants) on the same physical cloud infrastructure, while preserving isolation, governance, and lifecycle safety.VCF does not implement multi-tenancy at a single layer.
It is layered, intentional, and asymmetric.
VCF separates infrastructure tenancy from consumption tenancy.
This is the key to understanding everything else.Where it lives
Workload Domains Clusters NSX segments Resource pools Who owns it
Platform / Cloud Admins What it provides
Strong isolation Failure-domain separation Compliance boundaries Important
Infrastructure tenancy is coarse-grained Tenants do not see this layer Think: “Which hardware and fabric does this workload ultimately land on?”Where it lives
Organizations Projects Policies, quotas, approvals This layer is primarily owned by VCF Automation.Organizations
Top-level tenant boundary Represents a company, business unit, or customer Defines identity, access, quotas, and governance Projects
Sub-tenants within an organization Environment- or team-scoped (Dev / Test / Prod, Team A / Team B) This is where true SaaS-like multi-tenancy exists.Depending on workload type:
vSphere constructs Backed by resource pools, folders, NSX isolation Supervisor Namespaces Mapped (typically) 1-to-1 with Projects Enforced by vSphere + Kubernetes RBAC Key subtlety
Supervisor Namespaces are execution boundaries, not business tenants.
They implement tenancy; they are not the tenant itself.VCF Infrastructure (shared)

Just Kubernetes namespaces Just vCenter folders Just NSX segments A single RBAC model VCF deliberately avoids one-layer tenancy, because no single layer can satisfy:
Security Governance Lifecycle safety Operational clarity Isolation is compositional, not singular.
Strong isolation without hardware duplication Clear separation of duties Supports enterprise and service-provider use cases Preserves lifecycle determinism Conceptually complex Multiple abstractions to understand Requires discipline in mapping orgs/projects/namespaces VCF optimizes for large-scale, regulated environments, not minimalism.But: no single analogy maps perfectly — this is a hybrid cloud model.
Multi-tenancy in VCF is layered Organizations &amp; Projects define business tenancy Supervisor Namespaces enforce runtime isolation Workload Domains protect lifecycle and failure domains This design balances power, safety, and scale If you want, next we can:
Walk through RBAC flows across org → project → namespace Compare VCF multi-tenancy vs pure Kubernetes Discuss anti-patterns (where people get this wrong) Map multi-tenancy to chargeback / showback models

It is not an infrastructure tool and not VCF itself—it’s the global account &amp; entitlement layer that sits above VCF.If vCenter answers “what is running?”, CSC answers:
“Who are you, what are you entitled to, and which VMware services can you access?”
VMware SaaS Layer
└── Cloud Services Console (CSC) ├── Identity &amp; Org management ├── Subscriptions &amp; entitlements └── Access to VMware cloud services On-prem / Private Cloud
└── VCF ├── vSphere / NSX / vSAN └── SDDC Manager Runs as: VMware-hosted SaaS Audience: Org owners, platform leads, service-provider admins Does not touch datapaths or place workloads Defines Organizations Manages users, roles, and access Integrates with enterprise IdPs (SSO) This is business identity, not vCenter RBAC.
Shows what your org is entitled to: VCF subscriptions Optional VMware services Central place to view contracts → services CSC does not meter usage—that’s elsewhere.From CSC you access:
Support portals VMware cloud SaaS Management consoles (where applicable) Think of CSC as the front door, not the engine room.CSC ≠ BSC
CSC is VMware-global; BSC is VCF-specific.
CSC knows about your subscriptions VCF consumes those entitlements CSC does not: Provision domains Run LCM Enforce quotas Observe performance That work stays on-prem with VCF components.
❌ Not part of the VCF runtime ❌ Not an ops or automation tool ❌ Not a billing/metering engine ❌ Not a tenant boundary for workloads It’s administrative and commercial, by design.If VCF is:
“Your private cloud platform”
Then CSC is:
“Your VMware account and service access hub”
Comparable to a cloud provider account console, not a cluster manager.
Cloud Services Console = SaaS identity &amp; entitlement layer Global across VMware services Adjacent to VCF, not embedded in it Often confused with Business Services Console—they serve different roles If you want next, we can draw a clean diagram showing CSC → BSC → Usage Meter → VCF, or map Organization concepts across CSC, BSC, and VCF Automation side-by-side.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/cloud-services-console.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Cloud Services Console.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:13:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2024/08/featured-image.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2024/08/featured-image.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Workflow]]></title><description><![CDATA[merge to key workflow concepts and also move it to somewhere else.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Workflow.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:13:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VMware Data Services Manager]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Image" src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/dsm/data-services-manager/2-1/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/2840bcee-02a4-4da0-a4de-7017c7f33fb7.original.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/cormachogan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dsm_deploy_small.jpg?ssl=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">VMware Data Services Manager (DSM) is a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) control plane that lets platform teams offer databases as a managed service on top of VCF infrastructure—while keeping infrastructure, security, and lifecycle control centralized.It answers:
“How do we provide self-service databases without giving users raw VM access?”
VCF
├── vSphere / vSAN / NSX
├── SDDC Manager (infra lifecycle)
│
└── VMware Data Services Manager ├── Control Plane (policies, APIs, UI) └── Data Plane └── Database VMs (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) Runs on: VCF infrastructure Consumes: vSphere, NSX, storage policies Exposes: A database service interface to users DSM is above infrastructure, below applications.
Provision databases in minutes Automated: Day-0 setup Day-1 operations Day-2 patching &amp; upgrades Consistent configurations every time No more hand-built “special” DB VMs.
Platform team controls: VM templates Storage policies Network placement Backup &amp; security posture Application teams control: DB provisioning Scaling (within limits) Credentials (scoped) This maps cleanly to enterprise governance models.Databases are deployed with:
Approved VM shapes Approved storage classes Approved NSX segments Approved HA / backup models Users pick “what”, not “how”.DSM automates:
Database-aware backups Snapshots Restore workflows Optional replication patterns This is database lifecycle, not just VM lifecycle.DSM is not required for VCF.DSM targets enterprises modernizing gradually, not cloud-native purists.This distinction matters:
SDDC Manager: Patches ESXi, NSX, vCenter DSM: Patches databases Manages DB templates Controls DB version drift They are complementary, not overlapping.If VCF is:
“Infrastructure as a managed fleet”
Then DSM is:
“Databases as a managed service on that fleet”
Comparable to:
AWS RDS (conceptually) Azure SQL (conceptually) …but on-prem / private cloud, with enterprise control.Enterprises want:
Self-service databases Fewer snowflake DB VMs Safer operations Faster delivery Without:
Giving developers vCenter access Losing compliance control Rewriting everything for Kubernetes DSM is VMware’s answer to that middle ground.
VMware Data Services Manager = DBaaS control plane Runs on, but is not part of, VCF core Enforces policy, separation of duties, and lifecycle automation Best for VM-based enterprise databases Optional, but powerful for platform teams If you want, next we can:
Compare DSM vs Aria Automation DB blueprints Map DSM to AWS RDS concepts Or discuss why DSM struggles (and where it shines) in real deployments Just tell me which direction you want to go.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/vmware-data-services-manager.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/VMware Data Services Manager.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:12:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/dsm/data-services-manager/2-1/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/2840bcee-02a4-4da0-a4de-7017c7f33fb7.original.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/dsm/data-services-manager/2-1/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/2840bcee-02a4-4da0-a4de-7017c7f33fb7.original.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[VMware Skyline]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Image" src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-5-2-and-earlier/4-5/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/f3148087-2d46-4bdd-8144-71b73b43cadb.original.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/78/2022/01/Skyline-Screenshot.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"><br><img alt="Image" src="https://blogs.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2024/12/ClusterHealth-Figure-01.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">Yes — VMware Skyline is still part of the VMware ecosystem in VCF 9.x, but its role has shifted.
It is not a core runtime component of VCF, but a supportability and proactive intelligence service that complements VCF fleet operations, especially for production environments.VMware Skyline is a proactive support and health intelligence service that continuously analyzes your VMware environment and surfaces: Configuration risks Known issues Upgrade blockers Security advisories Best-practice deviations It answers:
“What is likely to break, and what should I fix before it does?”
VCF Environment
├── vCenter / ESXi
├── NSX
├── vSAN
├── SDDC Manager

└── Skyline ├── Telemetry collection ├── Health &amp; risk analysis └── Proactive recommendations
Key point:
Skyline observes the fleet — it does not control it.
Skyline is VCF-adjacent, not VCF-core.In VCF 9.x: Skyline continues to support: vSphere NSX vSAN SDDC Manager Skyline findings are especially valuable for: LCM readiness Upgrade prechecks Fleet hygiene However: Some operational insights now overlap with: Aria Operations Built-in health checks Skyline remains support-driven, not ops-driven Skyline correlates your environment against: Known VMware issues Field advisories Support KB patterns This is knowledge you cannot replicate locally.Before you run LCM in VCF: Skyline can flag: Unsupported configs Known bad upgrade paths Latent drift issues Think of it as:
“Support’s brain looking at your fleet before you upgrade.”
Skyline shines when: You have many domains You have many vCenters You want a single risk posture view This aligns naturally with VCF fleet management.Skyline is insight, not control.Skyline is the supportability lens.If SDDC Manager is:

“How do we keep all of these consistent, compliant, secure, and up-to-date over years?”
Below is a layered view, aligned with how VCF actually works. Central license inventory Assignment to: vCenter / ESXi NSX vSAN Alignment with subscription usage SDDC Manager VCF Usage Meter VCF Business Services Console Licenses are fleet-level entitlements, not per-host snowflakes.
VCF ensures: No silent overuse No orphaned entitlements Auditable usage SDDC Manager Bring-up (Day-0) Patching &amp; upgrades (Day-2) Version skew prevention Compatibility matrices (vSphere, NSX, firmware) Upgrades are coordinated across domains Versions are locked as a bill of materials Drift is actively prevented You upgrade the fleet, not “a vCenter here and there.” vCenter SSO External IdPs (AD / LDAP / OIDC) Role-based access (RBAC) VCF Automation Organizations &amp; Projects Consistent role models Central auth sources Separation of duties across domains Key point:
IAM is federated but standardized across the fleet.
No bespoke admin models per domain. vCenter ESXi hosts NSX Managers &amp; Edges Internal APIs Trust relationships Certificate sprawl Expiration risk Manual rotation = outage risk Centralized visibility via SDDC Manager Supported rotation workflows Integration with enterprise CAs Certificates are fleet-scale secrets, not local files. Appliance passwords Service accounts Inter-component credentials Bootstrap secrets Password rotation must be: Coordinated Non-disruptive Auditable VCF: Tracks credentials centrally Rotates safely Prevents “unknown admin password” scenarios This is operational hygiene at scale. Cluster settings (HA, DRS, admission control) NSX transport &amp; policies Storage policies Network constructs Domain-level invariants Configuration is declared once and enforced everywhere.
VCF: Applies opinionated defaults Detects unsupported deviations Blocks actions that would break fleet integrity This is closer to policy enforcement than “config files.” Automation targeting Chargeback / showback Compliance classification Ownership &amp; environment labeling Tags provide horizontal metadata across: Domains Clusters VMs Datastores Think of tags as:
“The control plane’s labeling system for infrastructure objects.”

It centralizes network policy (port groups, uplinks, security, QoS) instead of configuring each host individually.VCF standardizes on VDS as the baseline virtual networking fabric.VMware Cloud Foundation
└── vSphere └── vCenter Server └── vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) ├── ESXi Host A ├── ESXi Host B └── ESXi Host C └── Port Groups → VM vNICs Implemented by: VMware vSphere Managed in: VMware vCenter Server Used by: ESXi hosts, VMs, NSX transport nodes Centralized L2 switching Consistent port group configuration NIC teaming &amp; uplinks Traffic shaping, security, VLAN tagging Host lifecycle safety (no per-host drift) Think of it as:
“One virtual switch, shared by the whole cluster.”
VCF requires VDS because automation and upgrades depend on consistency.A Distributed Port Group defines: VLAN ID(s) Security policies (promiscuous mode, MAC changes) Traffic shaping Teaming / failover VM vNICs attach to port groups, not directly to the switch.This is where confusion often arises. VDS = underlay L2 switch NSX = overlay networking NSX creates overlay segments Overlay traffic is encapsulated (GENEVE) Encapsulated packets ride over VDS uplinks NSX does not replace VDS — it depends on it.
In VCF: Management Domain has a predefined VDS Workload Domains get their own VDS NSX transport zones bind to VDS uplinks Lifecycle (patching, expansion) assumes VDS presence You rarely “design” VDS in VCF — it’s opinionated and enforced. ❌ Not a router (no L3) ❌ Not an NSX Segment ❌ Not a tenant boundary ❌ Not optional in VCF If VDS is:
“A shared Ethernet switch for ESXi hosts”
Then NSX Segment is:
“A logical network built on top of that switch.”
Different layers, different jobs. VDS is the foundational virtual switch in VCF Provides centralized, cluster-wide L2 networking Required for NSX and VCF lifecycle operations NSX overlays run on top of VDS, not instead of it If you want, next we can explicitly trace a packet:
VM vNIC → NSX Segment → VDS → NSX Edge → Physical network
That walkthrough usually locks the mental model in place.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/vds.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Core Runtimes/vSAN/VDS.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:02:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/6e9e9fbf-e102-4f9c-a036-3a4bd255d7bf.original.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/6e9e9fbf-e102-4f9c-a036-3a4bd255d7bf.original.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[vNUMA]]></title><description><![CDATA[Let’s start with physical NUMA.<img alt="NUMA-1.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/numa-1.png" target="_self">NUMA stands for non-uniform memory accessNUMA is a physical server architecture used by modern multi-socket systems.
Each CPU socket has: Its own local memory
Faster access to that local memory Accessing memory attached to another socket is slower
non-uniform here does not mean “processes access memory unevenly”; it is from a hardware perspective, and simply means “memory access latency is not the same for all memory locations”Hence: Memory access time is not uniformYou can think of it as:
Two cities (CPU sockets)
Each city has its own warehouse (memory)
Shipping inside the city is fast
Shipping between cities takes longer
NUMA provides massive performance gain if locality is respected.Assume there is a workload that:
Runs on CPU-0
But frequently accesses memory on CPU-1
Then, performance will drop due to latency and cache penalties. This is invisible at the OS level unless NUMA-aware.In a NUMA-aware system, CPU threads are scheduled to prefer running on CPUs that are near the memory they already use, not the other way around.
All DRAM is: Equidistant (or close enough)
Reached through a shared memory controller or fabric Differences exist, but: They are not tied to CPU identity
They are mostly hidden from software Software does not (and cannot) reason about “which CPU core owns which memory” From the OS perspective: “Memory is one big pool” Latency variance exists, but not topologically anchored.
In contrast, in NUMA, each CPU socket has its own local memory controller and DRAM; remote memory is reached via an interconnect and is slower.vNUMA is how a hypervisor exposes NUMA topology to a VM.
The VM sees virtual NUMA nodes
Each vNUMA node has: vCPUs
Assigned memory Guest OS can schedule intelligently inside the VM
vNUMA is NUMA-awareness for virtual machinesWithout vNUMA:
Guest OS thinks memory is uniform
Hypervisor silently shuffles memory
Cache locality is lost
With vNUMA:
Guest OS: Allocates memory locally
Schedules threads close to memory Databases, JVMs, etc., perform much better
Tangential (but not directly-related-to) NUMA is SR-IOV.<br><img alt="sriovarchitecture.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/sriovarchitecture.png" target="_self">SR-IOV allows one physical PCIe device (NIC, GPU, HBA) to present:
One Physical Function (PF)
Multiple Virtual Functions (VFs)
The number of VFs an SR-IOV-enabled device can expose is fundamentally limited by the device’s hardware design, firmware, and onboard resources.SR-IOV devices expose a capability like:Total VFs supported: NThis value is:
Burned into silicon
Sometimes further capped by firmware
Sometimes configurable downward (but not upward)
Typical real-world numbers:
8
16
32
64
128
(High-end SmartNICs may go higher)
You cannot exceed this, no matter what the OS or hypervisor wants.Each VF:
Can be assigned directly to a VM
Bypasses the hypervisor datapath
When a VF is assigned:
The VF is bound to the VM
The VM sees it as a native PCIe device
The guest driver talks directly to hardware
Packets do not traverse: vSwitch
vNIC
vDS
software datapaths <br><a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> does not schedule or inspect traffic
This is why SR-IOV delivers:
Near bare-metal latency
Deterministic throughput
Minimal jitter <br><a data-href="vMotion" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a> flexibility (often)
Snapshot support (often)
Hypervisor mediation
Some observability
They solve different problems:An SR-IOV VF is physically attached to:
A PCIe root complex
Which belongs to one NUMA node
If:
VM vCPUs run on NUMA node 0
SR-IOV NIC VF is on NUMA node 1
You now have remote memory + remote I/O: Worst-case latency scenario.This is critical for performance workloads.When using SR-IOV:
Align: VM vCPUs
VM memory
PCIe device To the same NUMA node
This may require:
NUMA-aware placement
Host pinning
Careful cluster design

Many tenants (Pepsi, Coca Cola, Sprite, Pizza Hut)
Each tenant has an external Vault (or Vault instance) with paths that can overlap: credentials/db/finance is a common example Sync into an internal OpenBao (or internal Vault) via ESO
Inject into workloads via Vault Sidecar Injector
You want no path collisions and no possibility of cross-tenant access
There are two separate problems:
Storage namespace collision in internal OpenBao
Runtime authorization when workloads fetch secrets (injection)
<br>
Note: Only Organization Administrator is able to create secrets in the current system; not sure if the same applies for the VCF Secret Service. That’s something to keep in mind.
See <a data-href="VCF Roles and Permissions" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/vcf-roles-and-permissions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Roles and Permissions</a>
this is the first half of the problem.Based on the official VCF Secret Service docs, a lot of the “last-mile consumption” is already solved (create secret → store it → inject it into pods/VMs as files), but tenancy isolation is explicitly coarse and largely stops at the Supervisor Namespace boundary. It’s there, but it’s not the fine-grained. That is any OpenBao secret bound to a namespace is visible to any workload in that namespace.That should be fine since tenants are effectively namespace-bound.The “Managing Secrets…” doc spells out delivery formats:
vSphere Pods → file mount under /vault/secrets/&lt;user-provided-name&gt;
VM Service VMs → disk-based transfer + read-only mount
VKS (guest) cluster pods → file mount similar to vSphere Pods
This solves consistent delivery semantics per workload type.
All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.
^ that is the granularity we get. Which may or may not be fine based on the customers’ requirements.Also it’s worth noting that any notion of Organization/Project tenancy in the Secret Store model does not exist by architecture (which is also fine because secrets are namespace-bound, and tenants are also namespace-bound).None of the flows refer to Organization/Project at all. They are consistently “pick a Supervisor namespace; secrets live there”.That’s consistent with what we discussed earlier: governance constructs don’t appear at runtime.The docs show a pattern like secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; for retrieval.
Secrets are stored in a “corresponding namespace” (meaning: per Supervisor namespace).
VKS isolation is only at Supervisor namespace level (explicit).
Within a namespace, all service accounts can read all secrets (explicit).
So the tenancy story is not missing — it’s just coarse:
Tenant isolation = Supervisor Namespace isolation (and nothing finer is guaranteed).
A safe mapping consistent with the doc’s retrieval convention would look like:
External: credentials/db/finance
Internal: secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/credentials/db/finance
(or secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;some-secret-name&gt; that contains those K/Vs)
That avoids cross-tenant collisions because the Supervisor namespace becomes the first path segment.According to the docs, all tenants share the same unified internal secrets store (OpenBao).In the doc’s annotation model, you specify a secret “path” in the injector annotation. They show:
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-...: "secret/data/demo/db-cred"
Inject Secrets in to a vSphere …
So for Pepsi, if you used the flattened name approach, you’d inject like:
secret/data/pepsi/auth__finance__db__creds
…and because the auth role is tied to the namespace (example role demo), Pepsi workloads would authenticate with role pepsi and read from the pepsi/* prefix. ✅ In this doc model, within a tenant’s Supervisor namespace, any Pepsi workload can access any Pepsi secret.
❌ Restricting secrets to only pods in a specific Kubernetes namespace inside the tenant is not supported here (especially for VKS guest clusters).
✅ OpenBao paths look like secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; (KV v2 style).
✅ In shared OpenBao, prevent collisions by ensuring the first path segment is the tenant namespace (pepsi, cocacola, …).
VCF Secret Store Service does have guardrails that prevent a Coca-Cola workload from mounting Pepsi secrets, as long as you stay within the supported model.But those guardrails are namespace-scoped, not “tenant-aware in the abstract”, and they rely on how identities and roles are provisioned, not on OpenBao magically inferring tenancy.The guardrails are not:
“OpenBao automatically understands tenants”
“Vault paths are globally protected by magic”
They are:
The Vault/OpenBao token that a workload receives is issued in the context of a specific Supervisor Namespace.
That token is not shared across namespaces.
So:
A Coca-Cola workload never gets the same token as a Pepsi workload
Tokens are not reusable across namespaces
This is enforced by Supervisor, not by Kubernetes RBAC alone.The injector examples in the docs consistently show:
a role name tied to the namespace (e.g. demo)
secrets read from secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/...
That implies (and matches how VMware typically wires these systems): Each Supervisor Namespace has a corresponding OpenBao role and policy.
You don’t see the policy YAML in the docs, but the model only works if: role pepsi → policy allows secret/data/pepsi/*
role cocacola → policy allows secret/data/cocacola/*
Otherwise the examples would be unsafe.
A pod can’t just arbitrarily say:
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: secret/data/pepsi/db
from another namespace, because:
the injector runs with Supervisor context
the auth role used is bound to the namespace
the token issued is constrained by that role
So even if a Coca-Cola pod requests a Pepsi path, the read fails.
That’s the critical point: request ≠ authorization.
ref:
“All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.”
That sentence is not saying:
“All namespaces can read all secrets.”
It’s saying:
“Within one Supervisor Namespace, we don’t give you finer-grained scoping.”
If we ensure that:
Pepsi secrets are materialized under secret/data/pepsi/...
Coca-Cola secrets under secret/data/cocacola/...
Then VCF Secret Store Service guardrails already align with that:
Pepsi workloads authenticate as “Pepsi namespace”
Pepsi role can only read secret/data/pepsi/*
Coca-Cola role cannot read Pepsi paths
So yes: If we respect the namespace-prefix contract, the rest of the consumption plumbing is already handled safely by VCF Secret Store Service.
We are not punching a hole in the security model by doing the sync.The model breaks only if you bypass the intended trust boundaries, for example:
A single ESO instance with a token that can write/read all tenant prefixes
Manually creating secrets in the wrong namespace
Reusing roles or tokens across namespaces
Exposing OpenBao externally and letting workloads authenticate out-of-band
Those are operator errors, not product gaps — but they’re exactly what auditors look for.VCF Secret Store Service enforces tenant isolation at the Supervisor Namespace boundary by issuing namespace-scoped identities and policies for secret access. As long as tenant secrets are materialized under their corresponding namespace paths, cross-tenant secret access is prevented by design. Fine-grained intra-namespace isolation is intentionally not provided.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/secrets-federation-notes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Secrets Federation Notes.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:29:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[vcf-services-image_b975c3]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-services-image_b975c3.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-services-image_b975c3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Assets/vcf-services-image_b975c3.png</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:22:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-services-image_b975c3.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vcf-services-image_b975c3.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Supervisor-VCF-Automation Relationship]]></title><description><![CDATA[┌────────────────────────────┐

<br>From the <a data-href="Guest Cluster" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/kubernetes-runtimes/tkg/guest-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Guest Cluster</a>’s perspective, Organizations and Projects do not exist; similarly there is no concept of an organization or project inside the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a> either.Supervisor namespaces intentionally mimic Kubernetes semantics:From the developer's laptop, they feel like ordinary Kubernetes namespaces.Here is where they differ though (mostly around ownership and LCM)in Supervisor namespaces, resource governance is outside Kubernetes.In Kubernetes:
CPU/memory limits = ResourceQuota
Storage = StorageClass + PVC
Network = CNI rules
In Supervisor:
CPU/memory = vSphere resource pools
Storage = datastore policies
Network = NSX segments
Limits are hard boundaries, not advisory
So when you say:
"This namespace gets 8 vCPU and 64 GB RAM"
That's not a Kubernetes promise---that's vSphere enforcing physics.Security model is in vSphere, not in KubernetesKubernetes RBAC applies inside the box vSphere already drew.That’s why certain Kubernetes admin actions are silently blocked even when RBAC says “allowed”.From Kubernetes’ POV:
It looks like a CNI plugin
In reality:
NSX owns: L2/L3 segments
Firewall rules
Load balancers Kubernetes asks politely. NSX decides.This matters for:
NetworkPolicy
Ingress behavior
Multi-tenant isolation
In vanilla K8s:
PVC requests storage
Cluster tries to satisfy it
In Supervisor:
PVC must map to pre-approved storage policies
Datastore capabilities are enforced externally
StorageClass ≈ view of vSphere policy, not a free-form construct.The goal of this abstraction is to:
Let Kubernetes users feel at home
Let infrastructure teams retain determinism
Avoid “Kubernetes ate my datacenter” chaos
So Supervisor namespaces are:
Kubernetes-compatible interfaces to vSphere-owned sandboxes Supervisor namespaces intentionally impersonate Kubernetes namespaces
Kubernetes sees them as native; operations are externally enforced
vSphere owns: lifecycle
resource limits
security boundaries Kubernetes operates within those constraints
Supervisor Namespace names are unique only within a Supervisor cluster, and every Supervisor Namespace is governed by exactly one Project; Organizations do not directly own namespaces.Supervisor Namespace names are not globally unique, nor organization-wide unique.<br>They are unique per <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br>Supervisor Namespaces are always associated with a <a data-href="Project" href="vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>.Organization
└── Project └── Supervisor Namespace(s) Namespace names are: ❌ not global
❌ not org-unique
❌ not project-unique
✅ unique per Supervisor cluster Namespace: belongs to exactly one Project
indirectly belongs to one Organization
never floats independently Here’s a concrete example:Org: Verizon
Project: West-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: sjc-01 - Namespace: edge-prod - Supervisor Cluster: lax-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← same name, totally fine Project: East-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: iad-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← also fine <br>Namespace names are <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>-scoped
Projects are mandatory governance owners
Organizations are containers of projects, not namespaces
Any apparent contradiction is UI simplification, not platform behavior

vSphere → virtualization engine (hypervisors, clusters, VMs)
VCD → cloud abstraction + multi-tenant control plane
VCF → opinionated full stack (compute + storage + networking + ops)
vSphere does not have native multitenancy, VCD enables multitenancy.

All workloads deployed within a namespace inherit its resource constraints and access rules.A Supervisor Namespace is not the same as a Kubernetes namespace, even though it appears similar at first glance.A Supervisor Namespace contains Kubernetes namespaces, but is not itself one.

A VVS is more than documentation. It typically includes:

Secure multi-tenancy
Kubernetes at scale
Identity-integrated access
Backup, DR, or compliance alignment
Without validated solutions:
Every customer invents their own pattern
Outcomes vary wildly
Support becomes guesswork
Validated Solutions reduce design risk and support friction.<br>Here, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a> is a programmable substrate, and Validated Solutions as approved programs.While names and scope evolve, common categories include:
Secure Cloud Infrastructure
Identity and Access Integration
Kubernetes Platform Enablement
Multi-tenant Cloud Architecture
Business Continuity / DR
Compliance-aligned deployments
Each one narrows a broad platform into a specific, repeatable design.They are not:
Reference “ideas”
Whitepapers
One-off examples
Mandatory architectures You can deviate—but once you do, you own the risk.
For architects and platform owners, Validated Solutions provide:
Faster time to value
Reduced design ambiguity
Predictable upgrades
Clear escalation paths Less freedom
Opinionated choices
Slower adoption of bleeding-edge features
This trade-off is deliberate.
VMware Validated Solutions are prescriptive, supported blueprints
They sit above VCF, not beside it
They reduce risk by constraining choice
They align architecture, operations, and lifecycle
Deviating is allowed—but unsupported paths are yours to own

An input parameter is an argument that the workflow processes when it runs. The user, an application, another workflow, or an action passes input parameters to a workflow for the workflow to process when it runs.For example, if a workflow resets a virtual machine, the workflow requires the name of the virtual machine as an input parameter.A workflow's output parameters represent the result from the workflow run. Output parameters can change when a workflow or a workflow element runs. During a workflow run, the workflow can receive the output parameters of other workflows as input parameters.For example, if a workflow creates a snapshot of a virtual machine, the output parameter for the workflow is the resulting snapshot.Workflow elements process data that they receive as input parameters, and set the resulting data as workflow variables or output parameters.Read-only workflow variables act as global constants for a workflow. Writable variables act as a workflow’s global variables.You can use variables to transfer data between the elements of a workflow.You can obtain variables in the following ways:
Define variables when you create a workflow.
Set the output parameter of a workflow element as a workflow variable.
Inherit variables from a configuration element.
A workflow schema is a graphical representation that shows the workflow as a flow diagram of interconnected workflow elements. The workflow schema is the most important element of a workflow as it determines its logic.When users run a workflow, they provide the values for the input parameters of the workflow in the workflow presentation.A workflow token represents a workflow that is running or has finished running.A workflow is an abstract description of a process that defines a generic sequence of steps and a generic set of required input parameters. When you run a workflow with a set of input parameters, you receive an instance of this abstract workflow that behaves according to the specific input parameters you give it. This specific instance of a finished or a running workflow is called a workflow token.Workflow Token Attributes are the specific parameters with which a workflow token runs.The workflow token attributes are an aggregation of the workflow's global variables and the specific input and output parameters with which you run the workflow token.<br>Next, you might want to look into <a data-href="Running VCF Operations Orchestrator Workflows" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/running-vcf-operations-orchestrator-workflows.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Running VCF Operations Orchestrator Workflows</a>, or you can check out <a data-href="VCF Operations Orchestrator" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/vcf-operations-orchestrator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations Orchestrator</a>.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/workflow-management/workflow.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Workflow Management/Workflow.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 06:23:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./https://vcf.wtf/assets/workflow-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[vMotion]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href="./https://vcf.wtf?query=tag:operations" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#operations">#operations</a><br><img alt="vmotion_migration_process.jpg" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vmotion_migration_process.jpg" target="_self"><br>vMotion is <a data-href="vSphere" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/vsphere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere</a>’s live-migration mechanism that moves a running VM from one <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> host to another with no downtime.<br>In <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="VMware Cloud Foundation" data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF</a>, vMotion is foundational plumbing—it’s how higher-level services (<a data-href="DRS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/object-model/cluster-services/drs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DRS</a>, maintenance workflows) actually move workloads.<br><img alt="vMotion-pagetrace2.webp" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vmotion-pagetrace2.webp" target="_self">VCF

It bridges the gap between infrastructure health and actual workload behavior, allowing operators to reason about issues in terms of applications rather than underlying components.At its core, Workload Operations answer:
Is the application running correctly from the user’s point of view—and if not, where is the breakdown?
Workload Operations continuously assess whether applications are functioning as intended.

Monitors performance indicators relevant to application behavior
Detects degradations before they escalate into outages
Distinguishes between infrastructure noise and real workload impact
This ensures operators focus on what matters to consumers, not just raw resource metrics.Beyond infrastructure signals, workload operations account for how applications are perceived by users.
Correlates performance data with service responsiveness
Helps identify issues that are invisible at the host or cluster level
Supports prioritization of incidents based on user impact
Improves alignment between platform teams and application owners
In effect, it reframes operations around service outcomes, not components.<br>For container-based applications, <a data-href="VCF Operations" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/vcf-operations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Operations</a> provides native awareness of Kubernetes workloads running on the platform.

Monitoring at cluster, namespace, and workload levels
Correlation between container behavior and underlying infrastructure signals
This tight integration eliminates blind spots that traditionally exist between virtualization and Kubernetes operations.By correlating workload-level symptoms with infrastructure-level signals, workload operations significantly shorten troubleshooting cycles.
Rapid isolation of whether issues originate in compute, storage, networking, or the application layer
Reduced hand-offs between infrastructure and platform teams
Faster root-cause identification for mixed VM and container environments
Improved mean time to resolution (MTTR)
Instead of “ping-pong debugging,” operators get end-to-end context.Workload Operations is:
Application-centric rather than component-centric
Equally applicable to VM-based and container-based workloads
Focused on availability, performance, and user impact
Workload Operations is not:
A deployment or CI/CD system
A replacement for application-level instrumentation
A tenant self-service or governance mechanism Workload Operations shift operational focus from infrastructure health to application outcomes
Native integration with Supervisor and VKS enables deep visibility for Kubernetes workloads

These components include:

<br>Integration with VMware Cloud Native Storage (<a data-href="CNS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/cns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CNS</a>) for persistent volumes
Persistent volume requests from a VKS cluster are passed to the Supervisor, which handles storage provisioning.The Cluster API provides declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs for:
Creating clusters
Configuring clusters
Managing cluster lifecycle
Inputs to the Cluster API include:
A resource describing the cluster itself
Resources describing the virtual machines that make up the cluster
Resources describing cluster add-ons
The Virtual Machine Service provides a declarative, Kubernetes-style API for managing virtual machines and associated vSphere resources.Key concepts include:
Virtual Machine Classes, which define reusable hardware configurations
Lifecycle management of control plane and worker node VMs that host a VKS cluster
The components that run inside a VKS cluster fall into four functional areas:
Authentication Webhook
A webhook running inside the cluster that validates user authentication tokens. Container Storage Interface (CSI) Plugin
A paravirtualized CSI driver that integrates with CNS through the Supervisor. Container Network Interface (CNI) Plugin
Provides pod networking capabilities. Cloud Provider Implementation
Supports creation and management of Kubernetes LoadBalancer services.
The VKS API is used to provision and manage VKS clusters. It is a declarative API accessed using kubectl and YAML manifests.You can download the VMware-enhanced kubectl binary from the Supervisor API endpoint.With the declarative model:
You define the desired state (number of nodes, VM sizes, Kubernetes version, storage, etc.)
VKS reconciles the actual state to match the desired state
To manage a cluster:
Define the cluster configuration in YAML.
Apply it using kubectl.
Update the YAML to modify the cluster over time. <br><a data-href="VKS Cluster Networking" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/kubernetes-runtimes/vks/platform-integration/vks-cluster-networking.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VKS Cluster Networking</a>

These pods use hardware-backed memory encryption to protect guest memory from being accessed by the hypervisor or other privileged components.This capability is powered by AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization–Encrypted State (SEV-ES).A confidential vSphere Pod is a Kubernetes Pod that runs inside a virtual machine configured with SEV-ES: This ensures that:
Memory contents are encrypted
CPU register state is protected
The hypervisor cannot read or tamper with guest memory
This is especially useful for workloads that require strong isolation guarantees, such as handling sensitive data or running regulated workloads.To enable confidential vSphere Pods, the following requirements must be met:
<br>The <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> host must run on hardware that supports AMD SEV-ES. <br><a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> 7.0 Update 2 or later is required.
SEV-ES must be enabled in the system BIOS.When enabling SEV-ES, configure the following: Minimum SEV non-ES ASID count
This value must be set to:
number of SEV-ES VMs + number of confidential vSphere Pods + 1 Example: 100 SEV-ES VMs
128 confidential vSphere Pods
→ Minimum value = 229 The maximum allowed value is typically 500, depending on hardware. To deploy a confidential pod, you enable SEV-ES at the pod specification level.Create a YAML manifest with the following key elements:
Enable confidential pod support via annotation
Explicitly set memory requests and limits (they must match)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: name: photon-pod namespace: my-podvm-ns annotations: vmware/confidential-pod: enabled
spec: restartPolicy: Never containers: - name: photon image: wcp-docker-ci.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/vmware/photon:1.0 command: ["/bin/sh"] args: ["-c", "while true; do echo hello, world!; sleep 1; done"] resources: requests: memory: "512Mi" limits: memory: "512Mi" Memory requests and limits must be identical for confidential pods.
Apply the manifest:kubectl apply -f &lt;yaml-file&gt;.yaml
Once submitted:
<br>The Scheduler selects an <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> host that supports SEV-ES
If no compatible host is available, the Pod remains unscheduled
If scheduled successfully, the Pod runs with encrypted memory
You can verify the pod deployment using:kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;
From the vSphere side, administrators can see the pod listed with:Encryption Mode: Confidential Compute Confidential vSphere Pods use AMD SEV-ES to protect memory contents.
Encryption is enforced at the hardware level and is transparent to workloads.
The feature requires: Compatible hardware
ESX 7.0 U2 or later
BIOS configuration for SEV-ES Configuration is done declaratively using Kubernetes YAML.
The Supervisor ensures scheduling only onto capable hosts.

Assigned to a vSphere Namespace
Exposed to VKS clusters deployed within that namespace
The storage policies determine:
Which datastores can be used
How volumes are provisioned
How placement and availability rules are enforced
Based on the assigned storage policies:
<br>The <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> automatically creates corresponding Kubernetes StorageClasses
These StorageClasses are made available inside the VKS cluster
Each storage policy results in two StorageClass variants:
One with Immediate volume binding
One with WaitForFirstConsumer volume binding
This allows DevOps teams to choose the appropriate provisioning behavior based on workload requirements.VKS clusters integrate with vSphere storage using Paravirtual CSI (pvCSI).
pvCSI is a modified version of the standard vSphere CNS-CSI driver
It runs inside the VKS cluster
It handles all storage-related operations initiated from the cluster
The pvCSI driver does not communicate directly with vCenter or CNS. Instead:
The pvCSI driver forwards storage requests to the Supervisor
The Supervisor routes the request to CNS (Cloud Native Storage)
<br><a data-href="CNS" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/cns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CNS</a> performs the actual storage operation in vSphere
Unlike CNS-CSI, pvCSI:
Does not require vCenter credentials
Operates using a service account within the namespace
Relies on the Supervisor for secure mediation
<br><img alt="vks-pv-creation-a7a9c4ee-5c78-40fe-9406-6ee986c5d4d9.original.png" src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vks-pv-creation-a7a9c4ee-5c78-40fe-9406-6ee986c5d4d9.original.png" target="_self">The following sequence describes how a persistent volume is created in a VKS cluster:
A DevOps engineer creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in the VKS cluster.
The request is received by the pvCSI driver.
pvCSI forwards the request to the Supervisor.
The Supervisor invokes the CNS API in vCenter to create the volume.
Once the volume is created, the information propagates back through the Supervisor.
The PVC and corresponding PV appear as Bound in both: The VKS cluster
The Supervisor view This ensures consistent visibility and lifecycle tracking across all layers.
VKS clusters rely on vSphere storage policies for persistent storage.
Storage policies determine where and how volumes are provisioned.
The Supervisor mediates all storage operations between VKS and vSphere.
pvCSI enables secure, credential-free storage operations from inside the cluster.
Storage resources appear consistently in both the VKS cluster and Supervisor views.

<br>A <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> is a logical grouping of ESX hosts that vCenter treats as a single resource pool and failure domain.
It exists only in vCenter
ESX hosts do not know they are “in a cluster”.
When you create a cluster in vCenter Server, you are telling:
“*These ESX hosts agree to be scheduled, balanced, and failed over together.”This enables cluster-level logic, such as
DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler): vCenter decides which host should run which VM.
When to rebalance the load. <br>Uses <a data-href="vMotion" href="vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a> to move VMs between hosts.

If a host dies: Other hosts detect it
vCenter (or preconfigured HA logic) restarts VMs elsewhere. Shared resource abstraction Instead of thinking: Host A: 64 cores Host B: 64 cores vCenter presents Cluster: 128 cores VM placement and limits are logical, not physical.A vSphere Cluster is not:Because from an operator’s perspective:

No VM Operator CRDs. In a Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are Kubernetes namespaces whose lifecycle, limits, and security are owned by vSphere.
In a guest cluster, namespaces are owned entirely by Kubernetes.

Tenancy is a business/trust concept. Supervisor Namespaces are execution slices that implement tenancy.
vCenter / API / UI ↓
Supervisor Namespace created ↓
Namespace appears in Kubernetes ↓
kubectl can now interact with it
^ This is the opposite of upstream Kubernetes.In a vSphere Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are created and owned by vSphere as Supervisor Namespaces. Kubernetes users cannot create namespaces directly; kubectl is used only to interact with namespaces after vSphere has provisioned them.
Supervisor Namespaces are created by vSphere
<br>kubectl create ns is not how tenancy is established. This will be explicitly denies on the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.
There is no concept of a regular tenant namespace on Supervisor
Kubernetes reflects what vSphere creates
Namespace lifecycle is deliberately centralized for safety
In a Supervisor cluster, Kubernetes cluster-admin privileges do not grant authority over physical resource allocation. Namespace creation and resource envelopes are owned by vSphere, and Kubernetes operates strictly within those bounds.Tenant: Coca-Cola

But this is also possible: Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke ├── ns-coke-dev ├── ns-coke-stage └── ns-coke-prod The only inverant is one supervisor namespace cannot belong
to multiple projects. Namespaces are unique per supervisor cluster.
Supervisor clusters are *isolation domains*, so global
uniqueness enforcement would have been 1) artificial
and 2) painful. Organization
└── Project └── Supervisor Namespace(s)
From vSphere's perspective, a Pod, VM, or VM-based Pod is just scheduled compute.Project is an automation construct.
Defined by Automation Admin persona.
Mapped to one or more Supervisor Namespaces.
Invisible to vSphere / Kubernetes.
Their purpose is to govern requests, not execution.
<br>From the <a data-href="Guest Cluster" href="tkg/guest-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Guest Cluster</a>’s perspective, Organizations and Projects do not exist; similarly there is no concept of an organization or project inside the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a> either.Supervisor namespaces intentionally mimic Kubernetes semantics:From the developer's laptop, they feel like ordinary Kubernetes namespaces.Here is where they differ though (mostly around ownership and LCM)in Supervisor namespaces, resource governance is outside Kubernetes.In Kubernetes:
CPU/memory limits = ResourceQuota
Storage = StorageClass + PVC
Network = CNI rules
In Supervisor:
CPU/memory = vSphere resource pools
Storage = datastore policies
Network = NSX segments
Limits are hard boundaries, not advisory
So when you say:
"This namespace gets 8 vCPU and 64 GB RAM"
That's not a Kubernetes promise---that's vSphere enforcing physics.Security model is in vSphere, not in KubernetesKubernetes RBAC applies inside the box vSphere already drew.That’s why certain Kubernetes admin actions are silently blocked even when RBAC says “allowed”.From Kubernetes’ POV:
It looks like a CNI plugin
In reality:
NSX owns: L2/L3 segments
Firewall rules
Load balancers Kubernetes asks politely. NSX decides.This matters for:
NetworkPolicy
Ingress behavior
Multi-tenant isolation
In vanilla K8s:
PVC requests storage
Cluster tries to satisfy it
In Supervisor:
PVC must map to pre-approved storage policies
Datastore capabilities are enforced externally
StorageClass ≈ view of vSphere policy, not a free-form construct.The goal of this abstraction is to:
Let Kubernetes users feel at home
Let infrastructure teams retain determinism
Avoid “Kubernetes ate my datacenter” chaos
So Supervisor namespaces are:
Kubernetes-compatible interfaces to vSphere-owned sandboxes Supervisor namespaces intentionally impersonate Kubernetes namespaces
Kubernetes sees them as native; operations are externally enforced
vSphere owns: lifecycle
resource limits
security boundaries Kubernetes operates within those constraints
Supervisor Namespace names are unique only within a Supervisor cluster, and every Supervisor Namespace is governed by exactly one Project; Organizations do not directly own namespaces.Supervisor Namespace names are not globally unique, nor organization-wide unique.<br>They are unique per <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br>Supervisor Namespaces are always associated with a <a data-href="Project" href="project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>.Organization
└── Project └── Supervisor Namespace(s) Namespace names are: ❌ not global
❌ not org-unique
❌ not project-unique
✅ unique per Supervisor cluster Namespace: belongs to exactly one Project
indirectly belongs to one Organization
never floats independently Here’s a concrete example:Org: Verizon
Project: West-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: sjc-01 - Namespace: edge-prod - Supervisor Cluster: lax-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← same name, totally fine Project: East-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: iad-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← also fine <br>Namespace names are <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>-scoped
Projects are mandatory governance owners
Organizations are containers of projects, not namespaces
Any apparent contradiction is UI simplification, not platform behavior

Labs services are typically not supported at the same guarantee level as core Supervisor Services and may be subject to change. Formerly known as the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service
Provides APIs to create and manage Kubernetes clusters
Enables declarative Kubernetes lifecycle management via Supervisor APIs. UI component for resource consumption inside Namespaces
Displays resources in the vSphere Client UI under Workload Management
Improves namespace Kubernetes consumption UX Framework for stateful services using vSAN
Enables highly available object and block storage services for cloud-native workloads Integrates Velero with Supervisor Kubernetes
Enables backup/restore of Kubernetes resources and volumes
Natively integrated into Supervisor cluster workflows Leverages cert-manager primitives
Issues certificates for workloads running on Supervisor or tenant clusters
Helps with workload TLS termination and secure communication Adds a container registry within the Supervisor cluster
Supports image scanning, signing, and lifecycle policies
Works with ingress and DNS services for external access
Ingress Controller (Contour):
Provides ingress routing and load balancing for Kubernetes workloads
Integrates with Envoy for traffic proxying
ExternalDNS:
Automatically updates DNS records based on exposed service endpoints
Connects to external DNS providers for dynamic record management
Supervisor Management Proxy:
Facilitates communication between management and workload networks when isolated
Ensures Supervisor components can reach required management endpoints
NSX Management Proxy:
Previously used for similar connectivity needs but is now deprecated in favor of Supervisor Management Proxy Enables native Supervisor APIs to expose data services to tenants
Integrates the Data Services Manager (DSM) with Supervisor Cluster workload consumption paths
Secret Store Service:
Native secret storage capabilities for Kubernetes workloads
ArgoCD Service:
Provides a GitOps delivery model for application deployments
Useful for declarative automation and continuous deployment workflows Supervisor Services are the core platform building blocks that make vSphere Supervisor extensible and cloud-capable.
These services cover Kubernetes lifecycle, storage, registry, ingress, DNS, certificate management, backup, data services consumption, secrets, and more.
They are installed per Supervisor Cluster, managed by platform administrators, and consumed by tenant workloads or automation layers like VCF Automation.
There is also a Labs Catalog for experimental or early-stage Supervisor Services.

compression algorithms for reality.A mental model is an internal, simplified representation of how something works in the real world. It’s the framework the mind uses to understand, predict, and decide—often without conscious awareness.It is a map, not the territory.In my view, a mental model is:
A conceptual structure in the mind
Built from experience, learning, and assumptions
Used to explain cause → effect and anticipate outcomes
It answers questions like:
“If I do X, what will probably happen?”
“Why did that fail?”
“What matters here—and what doesn’t?”
Imagine driving in a foreign city.
The actual city is reality: complex, messy, and full of detail
Your mental model is a rough subway map in your head
That map:
Omits small streets
Distorts distances
Focuses only on what helps you get from A → B
It is useful precisely because it ignores detail—even if it’s inaccurate in places.That is what this (mostly) directed acyclic graph of documents (with occasional—intentional—loops) is trying to establish for <a data-href="VMware Cloud Foundation" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/vmware-cloud-foundation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VMware Cloud Foundation</a>: A navigable mental map, not an exhaustive representation of reality.The goal is not to describe everything, but to surface the abstractions that help me (and you, dear reader) reason correctly.Mental models exist because the human brain cannot process full reality in real time.Mental models:
Reduce cognitive load
Enable faster decisions
Allow generalization from experience
A single concept can be viewed through multiple overlapping mental models.For example, a database can be seen as:
A storage engine
A consistency system
A failure domain
A political boundary (ownership and control) Each model is incomplete on its own.
Taken together, they are powerful.

A minimal, locked-down OS
The application(s)
Configuration defaults
Upgrade mechanisms
Health checks
Backup/restore hooks
Support boundaries (“only change things this way”)
The key idea is:
You manage the appliance as a product, not as a general-purpose OS.
Usually yes, but conceptually they can be:
One VM (vCenter)
Multiple tightly-coupled VMs (some NSX / telco components)
But still treated as one product unit
From the operator’s perspective:
You deploy “the appliance”
You don’t manage its internals individually
Once you accept that:
vCenter is a VM
Supervisor components are appliances
Then the stack becomes very consistent:

A unit of compute that consumes CPU, memory, storage, and networking, and is subject to lifecycle, policy, and governance.
VCF doesn’t care what the workload is at a philosophical level. It cares about:
How it is instantiated
How it is isolated
How it is scheduled
How it is governed
Which control plane owns it

many disposable units forming a service.A pod workload is a Kubernetes Pod running on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster.A pod on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster is not a traditional Kubernetes pod.
It is a vSphere Pod — Kubernetes-shaped, but vSphere-implemented.Key point:
A pod workload is not a VM pretending to be a container. Supervisor pods are VMs implementing container semantics, not containers implemented as VMs. A Supervisor pod is a Kubernetes Pod whose execution unit is a micro-VM, where the VM boundary replaces the Linux container boundary. The VM is the isolation primitive
The Pod is the semantic primitive
The container image is payload, not a process model
So the VM is not “pretending to be a container” —
it is implementing the Pod abstraction using a VM instead of a process.
Pod (Kubernetes API object) └─ Backed by └─ Ultra-lightweight VM └─ ESX └─ Hardware
It is:
A Kubernetes-native unit
Scheduled by Kubernetes
Governed by Kubernetes APIs
Backed by vSphere under the hood Kubernetes API (Supervisor cluster) is authoritative
vCenter supplies infrastructure, not lifecycle semantics
VCF Automation governs Kubernetes intent, not individual pods CPU / memory requested via Kubernetes requests &amp; limits
Scheduler decides placement
Isolation via: Namespaces
RBAC
Pod security
(Optionally) VM-backed pod runtimes Declarative (YAML)
Reconciliation-based
Pods are ephemeral
Restart ≠ failure
Replacement is normal Namespace-level quotas
Admission control
Image policies
Network policies VM workloads → legacy, stateful, pet-like systems
Pod workloads → cloud-native, stateless, cattle-like systems
VCF’s value is:
Running both on the same physical infrastructure, with unified policy and automation, without forcing one model onto the other.
Trying to manage pods like VMs breaks Kubernetes.
Trying to manage VMs like pods breaks operational reality.VCF keeps them separate but coordinated.<br>A pod workload in VCF is a Kubernetes-native execution unit scheduled and governed by the <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> Kubernetes control plane, consuming vSphere resources indirectly through Kubernetes abstractions—unlike a VM workload, which is a hypervisor-managed, OS-bearing unit directly governed by vCenter.

VMs are stateful machines
Pods are replaceable execution instances

API semantics → Kubernetes
Runtime semantics → vSphere / VM
Traditional Kubernetes Pods:
Share a Linux kernel
Rely on namespaces + cgroups
Are fast and efficient
But have weaker isolation (from a hypervisor POV)
vSphere Pods were created to:
Give VM-grade isolation
While keeping Pod-level developer UX
For multi-tenant / regulated environments
This matters a lot for:
Service providers
Telco
Regulated enterprise workloads
“Pods from different customers must never share a kernel”

No shared kubelet per “node”
Each pod is scheduled directly by vSphere
Kubernetes still thinks it’s scheduling Pods — but vSphere translates that into VM placement.So in vSphereland, “One Pod ~= Tiny VM”<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" src="assets/vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" target="_self"><br>

Kubernetes: Decides which pod should run vSphere: Decides where the pod-VM runs
Enforces CPU, memory, NUMA, HA, DRS
This is what “Kubernetes-native mode” really looks like under the hood. From the Pod’s perspective:
It has an IP
It mounts volumes
It exposes ports
Under the hood:
Networking is NSX-backed
Storage is datastore-policy-backe
Attach/detach happens at VM granularity
Again: Pod UX, VM machinery.
Despite the VM runtime, vSphere Pods still use:
Pod specs
Containers
Init containers
ConfigMaps
Volume mounts
Pod lifecycle (create/delete/restart)
Kubernetes Services (with some constraints)
So developers mostly don’t care—and that is by design. Regular Pod → process in a shared OS
vSphere Pod → process in its own micro-VM
Or:
Regular K8s → Linux container model
vSphere Pods → “micro-VM container” model
Essentially: vSphere Pods are not regular Kubernetes Pods
They are Pod-shaped workloads backed by per-Pod VMs
Kubernetes API semantics remain intact
Runtime isolation is hypervisor-level
This is intentional and central to Supervisor’s design

<a href=".?query=tag:todo" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#todo">#todo</a> what are Supervisor control plane components? <br>
Multi-Zone Deployment: A Multi-Zone Supervisor deployment uses three <a data-href="vSphere cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere cluster</a>s, placing each cluster into a <a data-href="vSphere Zone" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Zone</a>. vSphere Zones are used by workloads and Supervisor management components to deliver high availability and expose each cluster as an independent, consumable availability zone. This configuration provides a resilient, HA-capable platform. Additional vSphere Zones can be added after initial enablement. However, these additional zones are available for workload consumption only, not for Supervisor control plane components. Single Host: Also a Single-Zone Supervisor with a single Control Plane VM deployed to a single ESX host, with vSphere HA disabled. While it shares the same characteristics as other single-zone deployments, in this configuration, any host failure results in downtime for the Supervisor Control Plane and potentially for associated workloads. <br>

In vSphere Supervisor a tenant is namespace-bound.
There is no separate tenant object inside Kubernetes.
<br>A <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> is the tenant boundary at the vSphere-Kubernetes interface.
If you assume:
Tenant = Project → you’ll design the wrong thing
Tenant = Kubernetes namespace → you’ll under-secure
Tenant = Supervisor Namespace → things line up
“tenant namespace” is an informal shorthand for supervisor namespace. Organizations and Projects are governance overlays. They do not define the tenant.Kubernetes namespaces inside guest clusters are secondary scopes.<br>In <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> each tenant is realized as one (or more) <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s.<br>
<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vcf-a/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> sits above, provides governance (Organizations, Projects, quotas) and self-service, but does not define tenancy by itself.This is sometimes “informally” expressed as “tenant namespaces”. What is meant by it is a Supervisor Namespace.Or more precisely: In a Supervisor Cluster tenant == supervisor namespace (there is a 1-1 relationship).<br>In vSphere Supervisor, tenancy is realized through <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s, which serve as the execution and isolation boundary for tenants.When people say:
“tenant namespace”
“project namespace”
“customer namespace”
They almost always mean: A Supervisor Namespace allocated to that tenant. Kubernetes does not have a separate construct for this: It is a vSphere concept, projected as a namespace.A Supervisor Namespace can contain:
Pods
VMs
Entire guest Kubernetes clusters
Tenant
└── Supervisor Namespace ├── VM workloads ├── Pod workloads └── Guest K8s Cluster └── many Kubernetes namespaces
VCF Environment
└── vSphere (vCenter) └── Supervisor Cluster └── Supervisor Namespace ← TENANT BOUNDARY
At this layer:
Supervisor Namespace Has: Resource limits
Storage policies
Network segments
RBAC bindings Is created and owned by vCenter
Maps to: Resource pools
NSX constructs
Datastore permissions
This is where hard multitenancy lives. <br><img alt="supervisor-cluster.webp" src="assets/supervisor-cluster.webp" target="_self"><br><a href=".?query=tag:tenancy" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#tenancy">#tenancy</a>This is logical tenancy, not execution tenancy.Organization

└── Supervisor Cluster ├── ns-cocacola ← Tenant: Coca-Cola ├── ns-pepsi ← Tenant: Pepsi └── ns-pizzahut ← Tenant: Pizza Hut
Each tenant is a supervisor namespace.<br><img alt="Supervisor-Namespace.png" src="assets/supervisor-namespace.png" target="_self">For Coca-Cola (example):
Fixed CPU / memory quota
Dedicated or isolated NSX segment
Approved storage policies
RBAC scoped to Coca-Cola admins
Ability to run: Pods
VMs
Guest Kubernetes clusters
That namespace is the tenant boundary. Layer VCF automation on top of this:Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke-Prod └── Deployments → targets ns-cocacola Organization: Pepsi
└── Project: Pepsi-Shared └── Deployments → targets ns-pepsi
Organizations and Projects map to Supervisor Namespaces — they do not replace them.Automation gives:
Self-service catalogs
Approval workflows
Policy as code
Lifecycle orchestration
But the tenant still “lives” at the Supervisor Namespace.Scope
vCenter
Supervisor Cluster
NSX
Storage policies
Responsibilities
Create Supervisor Namespaces
Set quotas
Attach networks
Bind tenant identities
Enforce platform guardrails
Power level
God-mode
Not visible to customers
Scope
One Supervisor Namespace (e.g., ns-cocacola)
Kubernetes API within that namespace
Responsibilities
Manage workloads
Deploy guest clusters
Configure service
Delegate access internally
Cannot
See other tenants
Modify quotas
Escape namespace
This is who you hand the kubeconfig to.
Scope
Kubernetes RBAC inside tenant (supervisor) namespace
Possibly inside guest clusters
Responsibilities
Deploy apps
Manage services
Consume secrets
No infrastructure privileges
Scope
Automation policies
Catalogs
Projects
Approvals
This role:
Often held by Rackspace
Sometimes delegated partially to tenants
<br><a href=".?query=tag:secrets" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#secrets">#secrets</a>
Secrets do not cross Supervisor Namespaces
Identity trust roots often terminate there
Network policy enforcement happens there
Audit logs are scoped there
So when you say tenant == Supervisor Namespace,
then:
Security
Compliance
Billing
Automation
all align clearly.

vSphere is the platform (the whole virtualization stack)
vCenter Server is the control plane that manages the coordinates of that platform
ESXi is the hypervisor that runs on hardware and executes VMs.
I mentally see (but don’t tell) this as “vSphere is just marketing”:
There is nothing I can curl called vSphere. it is “air”. <img alt="what-is-vmware-vcenter-vs-vsphere-vs-esxi.webp" src="assets/what-is-vmware-vcenter-vs-vsphere-vs-esxi.webp" target="_self">VMware vSphere is a product suite, not a single binary.To be clear: vSphere is a product name, or a platform name.

<br>A <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> is a logical grouping of ESXi hosts that vCenter treats as a single resource pool and failure domain.
It exists only in vCenter
ESXi hosts do not know they are “in a cluster”.
When you create a cluster in vCenter Server, you are telling:
“*These ESXi hosts agree to be scheduled, balanced, and failed over together.”This enables cluster-level logic, such as
DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler): vCenter decides which host should run which VM.
When to rebalance the load. <br>Uses <a data-href="vMotion" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a> to move VMs between hosts. HA (High Availability) Hosts run a lightweight HA agent.
If a host dies: Other hosts detect it
vCenter (or preconfigured HA logic) restarts VMs elsewhere. Shared resource abstraction Instead of thinking: Host A: 64 cores Host B: 64 cores vCenter presents Cluster: 128 cores VM placement and limits are logical, not physical.A vSphere Cluster is not:Because from an operator’s perspective:
Hosts act like a pool
Failures are absorbed
Workloads move transparently

Connected to a guest clusterkubectl get ns
kubectl create ns foo

All of these will work as expected.
Supervisor namespaces → owns the cluster.
Guest cluster namespace → normal Kubernetes semantics.
# check Supervisor-specific APIs
kubectl api-resources | grep -i vm virtualmachines vmoperator.vmware.com # look at the nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide # look for VM Operator
kubectl get pods -A | grep vmoperator
Supervisor cluster nodes typically show:
ESXi-backed control-plane VMs.
Special node labels
VM Operator components
Guest clusters look like:
Standard linux nodes
kubelet-managed lifecycle
No VM Operator CRDs. In a Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are Kubernetes namespaces whose lifecycle, limits, and security are owned by vSphere.
In a guest cluster, namespaces are owned entirely by Kubernetes.

It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp; Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture. Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.
