VMware Live Recovery = continuous protection + fast failover + clean recovery, natively aligned with VCF operations.
VMware Live Recovery is not a hypervisor feature and not just storage replication.It lives at the platform services / operations layer of VCF.
Site failure
Cluster outage
Maintenance windows gone wrong Encrypted VMs
Malicious data corruption
Need for clean rollback instead of “latest replica” Near-zero RPO (seconds)
Change-block tracking
Continuous replication rather than periodic snapshots Automated failover / failback
Application-aware recovery ordering
Network remapping and IP preservation Roll back to a known-good state
Avoid restoring infected replicas
Immutable recovery points (depending on backing storage) Protect workloads: on-prem → on-prem
on-prem → cloud
cloud → cloud Strong alignment with hybrid VCF deployments
Primarily:
VM workloads
vSAN-backed storage
VCF-managed domains
It is not:
A Kubernetes-native backup system
A replacement for application-level backups
A secrets-or-identity-recovery tool
^ all these remain separate concerns.You can think of VCF as enforcing invariants:
“Workloads must be recoverable within defined SLOs.”
VMware Live Recovery is the enforcement mechanism for the resilience invariant:
If a site fails → recover
If data is corrupted → rewind safely
If ransomware hits → recover clean, fast, and confidently
VLR is

Operates at the VCF Operations layer, not the hypervisor
Focused on VM workloads, not containers or apps directly

It combines the power of VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) with VCF’s operational tooling to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations.Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.<br>HCX stands for Hybrid Cloud eXtension—it’s not just another name for <a data-href="vMotion" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a>. It’s a comprehensive application mobility platform from VMware that enables workload migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.VCF Operations HCX has the following capabilities:
Seamless workload migration. Migrate VMs and applications in waves live or in bulk with minimal or zero downtime.
Network extension. Extend networks while preserving IP addresses and topologies to maintain application connectivity.
Inter-and intra-VCF mobility. Enable workload mobility within and across multiple&nbsp;VCF instances, including site-to-site and region-to-region migrations.
Application placement optimization. Enables high-performance application mobility across different environments, making it easier to optimize workload placement based on business requirements.
At its heart, VCF Operations HCX is an application mobility platform that:
**Connects environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—with optimized, secure network interconnectivity.
Enables workload migration—live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) and applications between environments with minimal downtime.
Supports hybrid cloud adoption—making it easier to modernize, consolidate, or balance workloads across sites.
Essentially, it extends the capabilities of VCF so that moving workloads into, out of, or around your VCF estate is seamless and automated.VCF Operations HCX automates the process of moving VMs and applications from one environment to another. This includes:
Live migrations (zero or near-zero downtime)
Bulk migrations for large-scale moves
Cross-platform migrations (including non-vSphere sources in some scenarios)
Network extension so IPs/MACs remain consistent during migration
This makes migrations faster, less error-prone, and less disruptive than traditional approaches.HCX builds a secure, encrypted interconnect between sites that:
Extends Layer-2 networks across sites
Preserves VM networking so that workloads keep their addresses
Provides optimized tunnels tailored for high-speed bulk movement
Cloud adoption isn’t a one-time event — usage patterns change. HCX enables:
Moving workloads based on performance needs
Rebalancing for cost or compliance reasons
Continuous optimization of where workloads run
This is key in hybrid environments where business needs or performance requirements evolve over time.VCF Operations HCX has deeper integration with VCF:
Unified management &amp; single sign-on with other VCF components
Shared licensing managed through VCF Operations
Integrated planning &amp; execution workflows with VCF Operations for Networks
Easier deployment with a single unified HCX Manager appliance
That means less separate manual setup and a smoother experience from discovery to execution.Imagine you’re relocating a city’s services (libraries, police stations, hospitals) to a new smart city:
Traditional migration = manually moving each building piece by piece.
VCF Operations HCX = building a dedicated transit corridor where services can shift live without interruption, while preserving all their connections and addresses — all orchestrated by a central operations dashboard instead of manual labor.
<br>vMotion is VMware’s native live-migration technology for moving a running VM between <a data-href="ESX" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ESX</a> hosts (including memory and CPU state), usually within the same <a data-href="VCF Domain" href="./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-domain.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Domain</a> or cluster.HCX doesn’t replace vMotion; it leverages it as one migration method (called “HCX vMotion”) when moving workloads between HCX-connected sites. It also supports:
Cold Migration: Powered-off VMs
Bulk Migration: Parallel, batched workloads
Replication-Assisted vMotion: Parallel live migrations via replication + vMotion
So, vMotion is a component inside HCX’s larger orchestration and connectivity framework. VCF Operations HCX is VMware’s integrated workload mobility solution within VMware Cloud Foundation.
It simplifies application migration and workload rebalancing across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
Via optimized network extension and interconnects, it preserves application connectivity and minimizes disruption.
Recent integrations with VCF improve deployment, management, and operational workflows.
If you want, I can explain specific HCX migration types or dive into how this works step-by-step during a VCF rollout.]]></description><link>./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vcf-operations-hcx.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Workload Mobility and Resilience/VCF Operations HCX.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Volkan Özçelik]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:25:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/hcx-bc63de63-befa-4cff-941b-d69c413dd8ac.original.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://vcf.wtf/assets/hcx-bc63de63-befa-4cff-941b-d69c413dd8ac.original.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[VCF Operations]]></title><description><![CDATA[VCF Operations&nbsp;helps your organization build, manage, operate and secure your private cloud infrastructure by deploying and maintaining its fleet-level components, providing visibility and enhanced performance across the workload and infrastructure stack, and helping your organization stay compliant with regulatory standards and organizational guidelines.VCF Operations has these functional areas:

A unit of compute that consumes CPU, memory, storage, and networking, and is subject to lifecycle, policy, and governance.
VCF doesn’t care what the workload is at a philosophical level. It cares about:
How it is instantiated
How it is isolated
How it is scheduled
How it is governed
Which control plane owns it
one machine per workloadA VM workload is a traditional virtual machine:
Runs on ESX
Has its own guest OS

many disposable units forming a service.A pod workload is a Kubernetes Pod running on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster.A pod on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster is not a traditional Kubernetes pod.
It is a vSphere Pod — Kubernetes-shaped, but vSphere-implemented.Key point:
A pod workload is not a VM pretending to be a container. Supervisor pods are VMs implementing container semantics, not containers implemented as VMs. A Supervisor pod is a Kubernetes Pod whose execution unit is a micro-VM, where the VM boundary replaces the Linux container boundary. The VM is the isolation primitive
The Pod is the semantic primitive
The container image is payload, not a process model
So the VM is not “pretending to be a container” —
it is implementing the Pod abstraction using a VM instead of a process.
Pod (Kubernetes API object) └─ Backed by └─ Ultra-lightweight VM └─ ESX └─ Hardware
It is:
A Kubernetes-native unit
Scheduled by Kubernetes
Governed by Kubernetes APIs
Backed by vSphere under the hood Kubernetes API (Supervisor cluster) is authoritative
vCenter supplies infrastructure, not lifecycle semantics
VCF Automation governs Kubernetes intent, not individual pods CPU / memory requested via Kubernetes requests &amp; limits
Scheduler decides placement
Isolation via: Namespaces
RBAC
Pod security
(Optionally) VM-backed pod runtimes Declarative (YAML)
Reconciliation-based
Pods are ephemeral
Restart ≠ failure
Replacement is normal Namespace-level quotas
Admission control
Image policies
Network policies VM workloads → legacy, stateful, pet-like systems
Pod workloads → cloud-native, stateless, cattle-like systems
VCF’s value is:
Running both on the same physical infrastructure, with unified policy and automation, without forcing one model onto the other.
Trying to manage pods like VMs breaks Kubernetes.
Trying to manage VMs like pods breaks operational reality.VCF keeps them separate but coordinated.<br>A pod workload in VCF is a Kubernetes-native execution unit scheduled and governed by the <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> Kubernetes control plane, consuming vSphere resources indirectly through Kubernetes abstractions—unlike a VM workload, which is a hypervisor-managed, OS-bearing unit directly governed by vCenter.
“Pod workload” ≠ “small VM”
Pod workloads are Kubernetes-first, not vSphere-first
VMs are stateful machines
Pods are replaceable execution instances
VCF supports both because enterprises need both

VCF is a full-stack Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform that delivers software-defined compute, storage, networking, security, and management.
Integrated automation enables a self-service platform to deploy VMs and containers for developer agility.
Hardened platform offering built-in resilience, scaling, and clustering for non-stop operations.
It provides automation and orchestration to simplify [Day 0](VCF Day 0 Tasks), [Day 1](VCF Day 1 Tasks), and [Day 2](VCF Day 2 Tasks) tasks.
It simplifies full stack deployment.
<br>The purpose of VCF is to design, plan, deploy, and manage your <a data-href="SDDC" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDDC</a> by using [automation](VCF Automation) capabilities.VMware Cloud Foundation is a unified private-cloud platform that combines the scale and agility of public cloud with security and performance of private cloud. delivering increased productivity and lower&nbsp;Total Cost of Ownership ([TCO](Total Cost of Ownership)).VCF consists of the following parts:These are the heavy-lifters of VCF.

Tenancy is a business/trust concept. Supervisor Namespaces are execution slices that implement tenancy.
vCenter / API / UI ↓
Supervisor Namespace created ↓
Namespace appears in Kubernetes ↓
kubectl can now interact with it
^ This is the opposite of upstream Kubernetes.In a vSphere Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are created and owned by vSphere as Supervisor Namespaces. Kubernetes users cannot create namespaces directly; kubectl is used only to interact with namespaces after vSphere has provisioned them.
Supervisor Namespaces are created by vSphere
<br>kubectl create ns is not how tenancy is established. This will be explicitly denies on the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.
There is no concept of a regular tenant namespace on Supervisor
Kubernetes reflects what vSphere creates
Namespace lifecycle is deliberately centralized for safety
In a Supervisor cluster, Kubernetes cluster-admin privileges do not grant authority over physical resource allocation. Namespace creation and resource envelopes are owned by vSphere, and Kubernetes operates strictly within those bounds.Tenant: Coca-Cola

From vSphere's perspective, a Pod, VM, or VM-based Pod is just scheduled compute.Project is an automation construct.
Defined by Automation Admin persona.
Mapped to one or more Supervisor Namespaces.
Invisible to vSphere / Kubernetes.
Their purpose is to govern requests, not execution.
<br>From the <a data-href="Guest Cluster" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/kubernetes-runtimes/tkg/guest-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Guest Cluster</a>’s perspective, Organizations and Projects do not exist; similarly there is no concept of an organization or project inside the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a> either.Supervisor namespaces intentionally mimic Kubernetes semantics:From the developer's laptop, they feel like ordinary Kubernetes namespaces.Here is where they differ though (mostly around ownership and LCM)in Supervisor namespaces, resource governance is outside Kubernetes.In Kubernetes:
CPU/memory limits = ResourceQuota
Storage = StorageClass + PVC
Network = CNI rules
In Supervisor:
CPU/memory = vSphere resource pools
Storage = datastore policies
Network = NSX segments
Limits are hard boundaries, not advisory
So when you say:
"This namespace gets 8 vCPU and 64 GB RAM"
That's not a Kubernetes promise---that's vSphere enforcing physics.Security model is in vSphere, not in KubernetesKubernetes RBAC applies inside the box vSphere already drew.That’s why certain Kubernetes admin actions are silently blocked even when RBAC says “allowed”.From Kubernetes’ POV:
It looks like a CNI plugin
In reality:
NSX owns: L2/L3 segments
Firewall rules
Load balancers Kubernetes asks politely. NSX decides.This matters for:
NetworkPolicy
Ingress behavior
Multi-tenant isolation
In vanilla K8s:
PVC requests storage
Cluster tries to satisfy it
In Supervisor:
PVC must map to pre-approved storage policies
Datastore capabilities are enforced externally
StorageClass ≈ view of vSphere policy, not a free-form construct.The goal of this abstraction is to:
Let Kubernetes users feel at home
Let infrastructure teams retain determinism
Avoid “Kubernetes ate my datacenter” chaos
So Supervisor namespaces are:
Kubernetes-compatible interfaces to vSphere-owned sandboxes Supervisor namespaces intentionally impersonate Kubernetes namespaces
Kubernetes sees them as native; operations are externally enforced
vSphere owns: lifecycle
resource limits
security boundaries Kubernetes operates within those constraints
Supervisor Namespace names are unique only within a Supervisor cluster, and every Supervisor Namespace is governed by exactly one Project; Organizations do not directly own namespaces.Supervisor Namespace names are not globally unique, nor organization-wide unique.<br>They are unique per <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br>Supervisor Namespaces are always associated with a <a data-href="Project" href="vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>.Organization
└── Project └── Supervisor Namespace(s) Namespace names are: ❌ not global
❌ not org-unique
❌ not project-unique
✅ unique per Supervisor cluster Namespace: belongs to exactly one Project
indirectly belongs to one Organization
never floats independently Here’s a concrete example:Org: Verizon
Project: West-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: sjc-01 - Namespace: edge-prod - Supervisor Cluster: lax-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← same name, totally fine Project: East-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: iad-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← also fine <br>Namespace names are <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>-scoped
Projects are mandatory governance owners
Organizations are containers of projects, not namespaces
Any apparent contradiction is UI simplification, not platform behavior

A concrete, addressable object: ESXi hosts

In practice, people often say:
“deploy this on Supervisor”
“connect to the Supervisor”
“namespace on Supervisor”
What they mean is: “the Kubernetes API exposed by the Supervisor-enabled vSphere cluster”
So colloquially: Supervisor ≈ Supervisor Cluster

You manage the appliance as a product, not as a general-purpose OS.
Usually yes, but conceptually they can be:
One VM (vCenter)
Multiple tightly-coupled VMs (some NSX / telco components)
But still treated as one product unit

You deploy “the appliance”
You don’t manage its internals individually

API semantics → Kubernetes
Runtime semantics → vSphere / VM
Traditional Kubernetes Pods:
Share a Linux kernel
Rely on namespaces + cgroups
Are fast and efficient
But have weaker isolation (from a hypervisor POV)
vSphere Pods were created to:
Give VM-grade isolation
While keeping Pod-level developer UX
For multi-tenant / regulated environments
This matters a lot for:
Service providers
Telco
Regulated enterprise workloads
“Pods from different customers must never share a kernel”
Regular Kubernetes:Node (Linux)
└── kubelet ├── Pod A ├── Pod B └── Pod C vSphere Pods:ESXi
├── Pod-VM A
├── Pod-VM B
└── Pod-VM C No shared container runtime
No shared kubelet per “node”
Each pod is scheduled directly by vSphere
Kubernetes still thinks it’s scheduling Pods — but vSphere translates that into VM placement.So in vSphereland, “One Pod ~= Tiny VM”<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" src="assets/vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" target="_self"><br>

Kubernetes: Decides which pod should run vSphere: Decides where the pod-VM runs
Enforces CPU, memory, NUMA, HA, DRS
This is what “Kubernetes-native mode” really looks like under the hood. From the Pod’s perspective:
It has an IP
It mounts volumes
It exposes ports
Under the hood:
Networking is NSX-backed
Storage is datastore-policy-backe
Attach/detach happens at VM granularity
Again: Pod UX, VM machinery.
Despite the VM runtime, vSphere Pods still use:
Pod specs
Containers
Init containers
ConfigMaps
Volume mounts
Pod lifecycle (create/delete/restart)
Kubernetes Services (with some constraints)
So developers mostly don’t care—and that is by design. Regular Pod → process in a shared OS
vSphere Pod → process in its own micro-VM
Or:
Regular K8s → Linux container model
vSphere Pods → “micro-VM container” model
Essentially: vSphere Pods are not regular Kubernetes Pods
They are Pod-shaped workloads backed by per-Pod VMs
Kubernetes API semantics remain intact
Runtime isolation is hypervisor-level
This is intentional and central to Supervisor’s design

The vSphere Supervisor is a Kubernetes control plane deployed as system-managed VMs on ESX, whose lifecycle is owned entirely by vCenter Server and whose purpose is to expose Kubernetes semantics directly on vSphere infrastructure.
The vSphere Supervisor physically lives as vCenter-managed Kubernetes control-plane VMs running on ESX hosts inside a vSphere cluster.

Multi-Zone Deployment: A Multi-Zone Supervisor deployment uses three <a data-href="vSphere cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere cluster</a>s, placing each cluster into a <a data-href="vSphere Zone" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Zone</a>. vSphere Zones are used by workloads and Supervisor management components to deliver high availability and expose each cluster as an independent, consumable availability zone.

Single Host: Also a Single-Zone Supervisor with a single Control Plane VM deployed to a single ESX host, with vSphere HA disabled.

Enforce business approval flows
Define org/project constructs
Those remain in:
VCF-A
Supervisor
Upstream automation layers
VCF-O observes those constructs after the fact.
Day 0 / Day 1 → VCF-A - Who can create? - What can be created? - Under what policies? Day 2 → VCF-O - Is it healthy? - Is it over/under-utilized? - Is it behaving strangely?

In vSphere Supervisor a tenant is namespace-bound.
There is no separate tenant object inside Kubernetes.
<br>A <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> is the tenant boundary at the vSphere-Kubernetes interface.
If you assume:
Tenant = Project → you’ll design the wrong thing
Tenant = Kubernetes namespace → you’ll under-secure
Tenant = Supervisor Namespace → things line up
“tenant namespace” is an informal shorthand for supervisor namespace. Organizations and Projects are governance overlays. They do not define the tenant.Kubernetes namespaces inside guest clusters are secondary scopes.<br>In <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> each tenant is realized as one (or more) <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s.<br>
<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> sits above, provides governance (Organizations, Projects, quotas) and self-service, but does not define tenancy by itself.This is sometimes “informally” expressed as “tenant namespaces”. What is meant by it is a Supervisor Namespace.Or more precisely: In a Supervisor Cluster tenant == supervisor namespace (there is a 1-1 relationship).<br>In vSphere Supervisor, tenancy is realized through <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/control-and-consumption/supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s, which serve as the execution and isolation boundary for tenants.When people say:
“tenant namespace”
“project namespace”
“customer namespace”
They almost always mean: A Supervisor Namespace allocated to that tenant. Kubernetes does not have a separate construct for this: It is a vSphere concept, projected as a namespace.A Supervisor Namespace can contain:
Pods
VMs
Entire guest Kubernetes clusters
Tenant
└── Supervisor Namespace ├── VM workloads ├── Pod workloads └── Guest K8s Cluster └── many Kubernetes namespaces
VCF Environment
└── vSphere (vCenter) └── Supervisor Cluster └── Supervisor Namespace ← TENANT BOUNDARY
At this layer:
Supervisor Namespace Has: Resource limits
Storage policies
Network segments
RBAC bindings Is created and owned by vCenter
Maps to: Resource pools
NSX constructs
Datastore permissions
This is where hard multitenancy lives. <br><img alt="supervisor-cluster.webp" src="assets/supervisor-cluster.webp" target="_self"><br><a href=".?query=tag:tenancy" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#tenancy">#tenancy</a>This is logical tenancy, not execution tenancy.Organization

But not execution boundaries.
VCF Environment (Rackspace)
└── Supervisor Cluster ├── ns-cocacola ← Tenant: Coca-Cola ├── ns-pepsi ← Tenant: Pepsi └── ns-pizzahut ← Tenant: Pizza Hut
Each tenant is a supervisor namespace.<br><img alt="Supervisor-Namespace.png" src="assets/supervisor-namespace.png" target="_self">For Coca-Cola (example):
Fixed CPU / memory quota
Dedicated or isolated NSX segment
Approved storage policies
RBAC scoped to Coca-Cola admins
Ability to run: Pods
VMs
Guest Kubernetes clusters
That namespace is the tenant boundary. Layer VCF automation on top of this:Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke-Prod └── Deployments → targets ns-cocacola Organization: Pepsi
└── Project: Pepsi-Shared └── Deployments → targets ns-pepsi
Organizations and Projects map to Supervisor Namespaces — they do not replace them.Automation gives:
Self-service catalogs
Approval workflows
Policy as code
Lifecycle orchestration
But the tenant still “lives” at the Supervisor Namespace.Scope
vCenter
Supervisor Cluster
NSX
Storage policies
Responsibilities
Create Supervisor Namespaces
Set quotas
Attach networks
Bind tenant identities
Enforce platform guardrails
Power level
God-mode
Not visible to customers
Scope
One Supervisor Namespace (e.g., ns-cocacola)
Kubernetes API within that namespace
Responsibilities
Manage workloads
Deploy guest clusters
Configure service
Delegate access internally
Cannot
See other tenants
Modify quotas
Escape namespace
This is who you hand the kubeconfig to.
Scope
Kubernetes RBAC inside tenant (supervisor) namespace
Possibly inside guest clusters
Responsibilities
Deploy apps
Manage services
Consume secrets
No infrastructure privileges
Scope
Automation policies
Catalogs
Projects
Approvals
This role:
Often held by Rackspace
Sometimes delegated partially to tenants
<br><a href=".?query=tag:secrets" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#secrets">#secrets</a>
Secrets do not cross Supervisor Namespaces
Identity trust roots often terminate there
Network policy enforcement happens there
Audit logs are scoped there
So when you say tenant == Supervisor Namespace,
then:
Security
Compliance
Billing
Automation
all align clearly.

<br>A <a data-href="vSphere Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Cluster</a> is a logical grouping of ESX hosts that vCenter treats as a single resource pool and failure domain.
It exists only in vCenter
ESX hosts do not know they are “in a cluster”.
When you create a cluster in vCenter Server, you are telling:
“*These ESX hosts agree to be scheduled, balanced, and failed over together.”This enables cluster-level logic, such as
DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler): vCenter decides which host should run which VM.
When to rebalance the load. <br>Uses <a data-href="vMotion" href="vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vMotion</a> to move VMs between hosts.

If a host dies: Other hosts detect it
vCenter (or preconfigured HA logic) restarts VMs elsewhere. Shared resource abstraction Instead of thinking: Host A: 64 cores Host B: 64 cores vCenter presents Cluster: 128 cores VM placement and limits are logical, not physical.A vSphere Cluster is not:Because from an operator’s perspective:

It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp; Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture. Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.

kubectl can now interact with it
^ This is the opposite of upstream Kubernetes.In a vSphere Supervisor cluster, tenant namespaces are created and owned by vSphere as Supervisor Namespaces. Kubernetes users cannot create namespaces directly; kubectl is used only to interact with namespaces after vSphere has provisioned them.
Supervisor Namespaces are created by vSphere
<br>kubectl create ns is not how tenancy is established. This will be explicitly denies on the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.
There is no concept of a regular tenant namespace on Supervisor
Kubernetes reflects what vSphere creates
Namespace lifecycle is deliberately centralized for safety
In a Supervisor cluster, Kubernetes cluster-admin privileges do not grant authority over physical resource allocation. Namespace creation and resource envelopes are owned by vSphere, and Kubernetes operates strictly within those bounds.Tenant: Coca-Cola

├── Project: Coke-Prod → ns-coke-prod
├── Project: Coke-Stage → ns-coke-stage

Each project maps to (ideally) one Supervisor Namespace.
But this is also possible: Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke ├── ns-coke-dev ├── ns-coke-stage └── ns-coke-prod The only inverant is one supervisor namespace cannot belong
to multiple projects. Namespaces are unique per supervisor cluster.
Supervisor clusters are *isolation domains*, so global
uniqueness enforcement would have been 1) artificial
and 2) painful. Organization

From vSphere's perspective, a Pod, VM, or VM-based Pod is just scheduled compute.Project is an automation construct.
Defined by Automation Admin persona.
Mapped to one or more Supervisor Namespaces.
Invisible to vSphere / Kubernetes.
Their purpose is to govern requests, not execution.
<br>From the <a data-href="Guest Cluster" href="tkg/guest-cluster.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Guest Cluster</a>’s perspective, Organizations and Projects do not exist; similarly there is no concept of an organization or project inside the <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a> either.Supervisor namespaces intentionally mimic Kubernetes semantics:From the developer's laptop, they feel like ordinary Kubernetes namespaces.Here is where they differ though (mostly around ownership and LCM)in Supervisor namespaces, resource governance is outside Kubernetes.In Kubernetes:
CPU/memory limits = ResourceQuota
Storage = StorageClass + PVC
Network = CNI rules
In Supervisor:
CPU/memory = vSphere resource pools
Storage = datastore policies
Network = NSX segments
Limits are hard boundaries, not advisory
So when you say:
"This namespace gets 8 vCPU and 64 GB RAM"
That's not a Kubernetes promise---that's vSphere enforcing physics.Security model is in vSphere, not in KubernetesKubernetes RBAC applies inside the box vSphere already drew.That’s why certain Kubernetes admin actions are silently blocked even when RBAC says “allowed”.From Kubernetes’ POV:
It looks like a CNI plugin
In reality:
NSX owns: L2/L3 segments
Firewall rules
Load balancers Kubernetes asks politely. NSX decides.This matters for:
NetworkPolicy
Ingress behavior
Multi-tenant isolation
In vanilla K8s:
PVC requests storage
Cluster tries to satisfy it
In Supervisor:
PVC must map to pre-approved storage policies
Datastore capabilities are enforced externally
StorageClass ≈ view of vSphere policy, not a free-form construct.The goal of this abstraction is to:
Let Kubernetes users feel at home
Let infrastructure teams retain determinism
Avoid “Kubernetes ate my datacenter” chaos
So Supervisor namespaces are:
Kubernetes-compatible interfaces to vSphere-owned sandboxes Supervisor namespaces intentionally impersonate Kubernetes namespaces
Kubernetes sees them as native; operations are externally enforced
vSphere owns: lifecycle
resource limits
security boundaries Kubernetes operates within those constraints
Supervisor Namespace names are unique only within a Supervisor cluster, and every Supervisor Namespace is governed by exactly one Project; Organizations do not directly own namespaces.Supervisor Namespace names are not globally unique, nor organization-wide unique.<br>They are unique per <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>.<br>Supervisor Namespaces are always associated with a <a data-href="Project" href="project.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Project</a>.Organization
└── Project └── Supervisor Namespace(s) Namespace names are: ❌ not global
❌ not org-unique
❌ not project-unique
✅ unique per Supervisor cluster Namespace: belongs to exactly one Project
indirectly belongs to one Organization
never floats independently Here’s a concrete example:Org: Verizon
Project: West-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: sjc-01 - Namespace: edge-prod - Supervisor Cluster: lax-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← same name, totally fine Project: East-Coast - Supervisor Cluster: iad-01 - Namespace: edge-prod ← also fine <br>Namespace names are <a data-href="Supervisor Cluster" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Cluster</a>-scoped
Projects are mandatory governance owners
Organizations are containers of projects, not namespaces
Any apparent contradiction is UI simplification, not platform behavior

In practice, people often say:
“deploy this on Supervisor”

So colloquially: Supervisor ≈ Supervisor Cluster

One VM (vCenter)
Multiple tightly-coupled VMs (some NSX / telco components)

A unit of compute that consumes CPU, memory, storage, and networking, and is subject to lifecycle, policy, and governance.

How it is isolated
How it is scheduled
How it is governed

many disposable units forming a service.A pod workload is a Kubernetes Pod running on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster.A pod on the vSphere Supervisor Cluster is not a traditional Kubernetes pod.
It is a vSphere Pod — Kubernetes-shaped, but vSphere-implemented.Key point:
A pod workload is not a VM pretending to be a container. Supervisor pods are VMs implementing container semantics, not containers implemented as VMs. A Supervisor pod is a Kubernetes Pod whose execution unit is a micro-VM, where the VM boundary replaces the Linux container boundary. The VM is the isolation primitive
The Pod is the semantic primitive
The container image is payload, not a process model
So the VM is not “pretending to be a container” —
it is implementing the Pod abstraction using a VM instead of a process.
Pod (Kubernetes API object) └─ Backed by └─ Ultra-lightweight VM └─ ESX └─ Hardware
It is:
A Kubernetes-native unit
Scheduled by Kubernetes
Governed by Kubernetes APIs
Backed by vSphere under the hood Kubernetes API (Supervisor cluster) is authoritative
vCenter supplies infrastructure, not lifecycle semantics
VCF Automation governs Kubernetes intent, not individual pods CPU / memory requested via Kubernetes requests &amp; limits
Scheduler decides placement
Isolation via: Namespaces
RBAC
Pod security
(Optionally) VM-backed pod runtimes Declarative (YAML)
Reconciliation-based
Pods are ephemeral
Restart ≠ failure
Replacement is normal Namespace-level quotas
Admission control
Image policies
Network policies VM workloads → legacy, stateful, pet-like systems
Pod workloads → cloud-native, stateless, cattle-like systems
VCF’s value is:
Running both on the same physical infrastructure, with unified policy and automation, without forcing one model onto the other.
Trying to manage pods like VMs breaks Kubernetes.
Trying to manage VMs like pods breaks operational reality.VCF keeps them separate but coordinated.<br>A pod workload in VCF is a Kubernetes-native execution unit scheduled and governed by the <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> Kubernetes control plane, consuming vSphere resources indirectly through Kubernetes abstractions—unlike a VM workload, which is a hypervisor-managed, OS-bearing unit directly governed by vCenter.

Kubernetes still thinks it’s scheduling Pods — but vSphere translates that into VM placement.So in vSphereland, “One Pod ~= Tiny VM”<br><img alt="vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" src="assets/vsphere-pod-d7cddcdc-2c10-4459-999e-bfa73ee28e8c.webp" target="_self"><br>

Kubernetes: Decides which pod should run vSphere: Decides where the pod-VM runs
Enforces CPU, memory, NUMA, HA, DRS
This is what “Kubernetes-native mode” really looks like under the hood. From the Pod’s perspective:
It has an IP
It mounts volumes
It exposes ports
Under the hood:
Networking is NSX-backed
Storage is datastore-policy-backe
Attach/detach happens at VM granularity
Again: Pod UX, VM machinery.
Despite the VM runtime, vSphere Pods still use:
Pod specs
Containers
Init containers
ConfigMaps
Volume mounts
Pod lifecycle (create/delete/restart)
Kubernetes Services (with some constraints)
So developers mostly don’t care—and that is by design. Regular Pod → process in a shared OS
vSphere Pod → process in its own micro-VM
Or:
Regular K8s → Linux container model
vSphere Pods → “micro-VM container” model
Essentially: vSphere Pods are not regular Kubernetes Pods
They are Pod-shaped workloads backed by per-Pod VMs
Kubernetes API semantics remain intact
Runtime isolation is hypervisor-level
This is intentional and central to Supervisor’s design

Many tenants (Pepsi, Coca Cola, Sprite, Pizza Hut)
Each tenant has an external Vault (or Vault instance) with paths that can overlap: credentials/db/finance is a common example Sync into an internal OpenBao (or internal Vault) via ESO
Inject into workloads via Vault Sidecar Injector
You want no path collisions and no possibility of cross-tenant access
There are two separate problems:
Storage namespace collision in internal OpenBao
Runtime authorization when workloads fetch secrets (injection)
this is the first half of the problem.Based on the official VCF Secret Service docs, a lot of the “last-mile consumption” is already solved (create secret → store it → inject it into pods/VMs as files), but tenancy isolation is explicitly coarse and largely stops at the Supervisor Namespace boundary. It’s there, but it’s not the fine-grained. That is any OpenBao secret bound to a namespace is visible to any workload in that namespace.That should be fine since tenants are effectively namespace-bound.The “Managing Secrets…” doc spells out delivery formats:
vSphere Pods → file mount under /vault/secrets/&lt;user-provided-name&gt;
VM Service VMs → disk-based transfer + read-only mount
VKS (guest) cluster pods → file mount similar to vSphere Pods
This solves consistent delivery semantics per workload type.
All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.
^ that is the granularity we get. Which may or may not be fine based on the customers’ requirements.Also it’s worth noting that any notion of Organization/Project tenancy in the Secret Store model does not exist by architecture (which is also fine because secrets are namespace-bound, and tenants are also namespace-bound).None of the flows refer to Organization/Project at all. They are consistently “pick a Supervisor namespace; secrets live there”.That’s consistent with what we discussed earlier: governance constructs don’t appear at runtime.The docs show a pattern like secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; for retrieval.
Secrets are stored in a “corresponding namespace” (meaning: per Supervisor namespace).
VKS isolation is only at Supervisor namespace level (explicit).
Within a namespace, all service accounts can read all secrets (explicit).
So the tenancy story is not missing — it’s just coarse:
Tenant isolation = Supervisor Namespace isolation (and nothing finer is guaranteed).
A safe mapping consistent with the doc’s retrieval convention would look like:
External: credentials/db/finance
Internal: secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/credentials/db/finance
(or secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;some-secret-name&gt; that contains those K/Vs)
That avoids cross-tenant collisions because the Supervisor namespace becomes the first path segment.According to the docs, all tenants share the same unified internal secrets store (OpenBao).In the doc’s annotation model, you specify a secret “path” in the injector annotation. They show:
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-...: "secret/data/demo/db-cred"
Inject Secrets in to a vSphere …
So for Pepsi, if you used the flattened name approach, you’d inject like:
secret/data/pepsi/auth__finance__db__creds
…and because the auth role is tied to the namespace (example role demo), Pepsi workloads would authenticate with role pepsi and read from the pepsi/* prefix. ✅ In this doc model, within a tenant’s Supervisor namespace, any Pepsi workload can access any Pepsi secret.
❌ Restricting secrets to only pods in a specific Kubernetes namespace inside the tenant is not supported here (especially for VKS guest clusters).
✅ OpenBao paths look like secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; (KV v2 style).
✅ In shared OpenBao, prevent collisions by ensuring the first path segment is the tenant namespace (pepsi, cocacola, …).
VCF Secret Store Service does have guardrails that prevent a Coca-Cola workload from mounting Pepsi secrets, as long as you stay within the supported model.But those guardrails are namespace-scoped, not “tenant-aware in the abstract”, and they rely on how identities and roles are provisioned, not on OpenBao magically inferring tenancy.The guardrails are not:
“OpenBao automatically understands tenants”
“Vault paths are globally protected by magic”
They are:
The Vault/OpenBao token that a workload receives is issued in the context of a specific Supervisor Namespace.
That token is not shared across namespaces.
So:
A Coca-Cola workload never gets the same token as a Pepsi workload
Tokens are not reusable across namespaces
This is enforced by Supervisor, not by Kubernetes RBAC alone.The injector examples in the docs consistently show:
a role name tied to the namespace (e.g. demo)
secrets read from secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/...
That implies (and matches how VMware typically wires these systems): Each Supervisor Namespace has a corresponding OpenBao role and policy.
You don’t see the policy YAML in the docs, but the model only works if: role pepsi → policy allows secret/data/pepsi/*
role cocacola → policy allows secret/data/cocacola/*
Otherwise the examples would be unsafe.
A pod can’t just arbitrarily say:
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: secret/data/pepsi/db
from another namespace, because:
the injector runs with Supervisor context
the auth role used is bound to the namespace
the token issued is constrained by that role
So even if a Coca-Cola pod requests a Pepsi path, the read fails.
That’s the critical point: request ≠ authorization.
ref:
“All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.”
That sentence is not saying:
“All namespaces can read all secrets.”
It’s saying:
“Within one Supervisor Namespace, we don’t give you finer-grained scoping.”
If we ensure that:
Pepsi secrets are materialized under secret/data/pepsi/...
Coca-Cola secrets under secret/data/cocacola/...
Then VCF Secret Store Service guardrails already align with that:
Pepsi workloads authenticate as “Pepsi namespace”
Pepsi role can only read secret/data/pepsi/*
Coca-Cola role cannot read Pepsi paths
So yes: If we respect the namespace-prefix contract, the rest of the consumption plumbing is already handled safely by VCF Secret Store Service.
We are not punching a hole in the security model by doing the sync.The model breaks only if you bypass the intended trust boundaries, for example:
A single ESO instance with a token that can write/read all tenant prefixes
Manually creating secrets in the wrong namespace
Reusing roles or tokens across namespaces
Exposing OpenBao externally and letting workloads authenticate out-of-band
Those are operator errors, not product gaps — but they’re exactly what auditors look for.VCF Secret Store Service enforces tenant isolation at the Supervisor Namespace boundary by issuing namespace-scoped identities and policies for secret access. As long as tenant secrets are materialized under their corresponding namespace paths, cross-tenant secret access is prevented by design. Fine-grained intra-namespace isolation is intentionally not provided.]]></description><link>secrets-federation-notes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Secrets Federation Notes.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 16:55:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VCF Automation and VCF Operations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="vcf-operations.webp" src="assets/vcf-operations.webp" target="_self">VCF-O does not:

In vSphere Supervisor a tenant is namespace-bound.
There is no separate tenant object inside Kubernetes.
<br>A <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a> is the tenant boundary at the vSphere-Kubernetes interface.
If you assume:
Tenant = Project → you’ll design the wrong thing
Tenant = Kubernetes namespace → you’ll under-secure
Tenant = Supervisor Namespace → things line up
“tenant namespace” is an informal shorthand for supervisor namespace. Organizations and Projects are governance overlays. They do not define the tenant.Kubernetes namespaces inside guest clusters are secondary scopes.<br>In <a data-href="vSphere Supervisor" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vSphere Supervisor</a> each tenant is realized as one (or more) <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s.<br>
<a data-href="VCF Automation" href="vcf/main-componets/engine/vcf-a/vcf-automation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VCF Automation</a> sits above, provides governance (Organizations, Projects, quotas) and self-service, but does not define tenancy by itself.This is sometimes “informally” expressed as “tenant namespaces”. What is meant by it is a Supervisor Namespace.Or more precisely: In a Supervisor Cluster tenant == supervisor namespace (there is a 1-1 relationship).<br>In vSphere Supervisor, tenancy is realized through <a data-href="Supervisor Namespace" href="supervisor-namespace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Supervisor Namespace</a>s, which serve as the execution and isolation boundary for tenants.When people say:
“tenant namespace”
“project namespace”
“customer namespace”
They almost always mean: A Supervisor Namespace allocated to that tenant. Kubernetes does not have a separate construct for this: It is a vSphere concept, projected as a namespace.A Supervisor Namespace can contain:
Pods
VMs
Entire guest Kubernetes clusters
Tenant
└── Supervisor Namespace ├── VM workloads ├── Pod workloads └── Guest K8s Cluster └── many Kubernetes namespaces

At this layer:
Supervisor Namespace Has: Resource limits
Storage policies

Each tenant is a supervisor namespace.<br><img alt="Supervisor-Namespace.png" src="assets/supervisor-namespace.png" target="_self">For Coca-Cola (example):
Fixed CPU / memory quota
Dedicated or isolated NSX segment
Approved storage policies
RBAC scoped to Coca-Cola admins
Ability to run: Pods
VMs
Guest Kubernetes clusters
That namespace is the tenant boundary. Layer VCF automation on top of this:Organization: Coca-Cola
└── Project: Coke-Prod └── Deployments → targets ns-cocacola Organization: Pepsi
└── Project: Pepsi-Shared └── Deployments → targets ns-pepsi
Organizations and Projects map to Supervisor Namespaces — they do not replace them.Automation gives:
Self-service catalogs
Approval workflows
Policy as code
Lifecycle orchestration
But the tenant still “lives” at the Supervisor Namespace.Scope
vCenter
Supervisor Cluster
NSX
Storage policies
Responsibilities
Create Supervisor Namespaces
Set quotas
Attach networks
Bind tenant identities
Enforce platform guardrails
Power level
God-mode
Not visible to customers
Scope
One Supervisor Namespace (e.g., ns-cocacola)
Kubernetes API within that namespace
Responsibilities
Manage workloads
Deploy guest clusters
Configure service
Delegate access internally
Cannot
See other tenants
Modify quotas
Escape namespace
This is who you hand the kubeconfig to.
Scope
Kubernetes RBAC inside tenant (supervisor) namespace
Possibly inside guest clusters
Responsibilities
Deploy apps
Manage services
Consume secrets
No infrastructure privileges
Scope
Automation policies
Catalogs
Projects
Approvals
This role:
Often held by Rackspace
Sometimes delegated partially to tenants
<br><a href=".?query=tag:secrets" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#secrets">#secrets</a>
Secrets do not cross Supervisor Namespaces
Identity trust roots often terminate there
Network policy enforcement happens there
Audit logs are scoped there
So when you say tenant == Supervisor Namespace,
then:
Security
Compliance
Billing
Automation
all align clearly.

It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp; Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture. Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.
