boundary” for consumption, not execution.An Organization is a logical tenant boundary that groups identity, policy, quotas, visibility, and approval flows for consuming infrastructure and platform services.It answers:\nWho is consuming?\nWhat are they allowed to consume?\nUnder which business rules?\n—not how workloads actually run.\n<br>Because <a data-href=\"Supervisor Namespace\"

blast radius\nThis is where:\nKubernetes says “no”\nvSphere enforces limits\nWorkloads are actually prevented from crossing boundaries Namespace = hard enforcement boundary\n<br>Organizations define intent and <a data-href=\"Governance\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/governance-and-compliance/governance.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener

to:\n“Who is allowed to mint isolation boundaries?”\nnot:\n“Where isolation happens.”\nA single Organization can own:\nMultiple Projects\nEach Project can map to: <br>One <a data-href=\"Supervisor

units, external customers)\nEnforces isolation in: Identity and Access\nVisibility\nQuotas and Limits\nChargeback / showback Organizations are where policies attach, such as:\nWho can request what\nApproval workflows\nBudget limits\nLease durations\nAllowed regions / environments\nAllowed workload types (VM, Kubernetes, services)\nThese policies then flow downward.Everything inside an Organization is:\nVisible only to that Organization (unless shared)\nGoverned consistently\nThis includes:\nProjects\nBlueprints / templates\nCatalog items\nRequests\nCost views\nOrganization\n├──

Blueprints in VCF Automation","icon":"","description":"A blueprint is a declarative template used to define and automate the deployment of infrastructure, applications, and services. It allows users to model complex cloud resources, such as VMs, networks, storage, and software components. Blueprints orchestrate the deployment of multiple resource in the VCF platform. It acts as a reusable design for deploying resources and services consistently. A design canvas is used to create a blueprint. YAML code is automatically generated. It describes infrastructure as code. The code editor also allows to type code directly or enter values.Blueprint Features Blueprint designer. &nbsp;The Blueprint Designer offers a single interface to create blueprints for various resource types, including single machines, multi-machi deployments, and multi-tiered applications. Declarative Infrastructure-as-Code. &nbsp;Blueprints define the desired state of the infrastructure using YAML or a visual designer, rather than specifying step-by-step instructions. Reusability and versioning. &nbsp;Blueprints can be versioned, imported, exported (YAML format), and shared across projects or even tenants, promoting reusability and collaboration. Self-Service provisioning. &nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;provides self-service portals where users can deploy and manage resources based on pre-defined blueprints. Inputs and Customization. &nbsp;Blueprint inputs enable customization during deployment, allowing users to select options like machine size or image. Governance. &nbsp;To ensure consistency, reusability, and governance across environments. Day 2 operations. &nbsp;Blueprints support day 2 operations, allowing for updates, modifications, and management of existing deployments. Blueprint Concepts Versioning. &nbsp;Blueprints can be versioned. At deployment time, you can select any of your versions to deploy. Resource objects. &nbsp;Resource objects represent the infrastructure components and services that are provisioned and managed in a blueprint. Dependencies between resources in blueprints. &nbsp;When you deploy a&nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;blueprint, one resource might need another resource to be available first. Instances. &nbsp;Instances are created when blueprints are deployed from the catalog. Day 2 actions. &nbsp;Actions that can be performed on the provisioned resource objects. Property groups. &nbsp;Instead of defining the same properties repeatedly across multiple blueprints, property groups enable you to define them once and then link them to various resources. This promotes consistency and simplifies management, as updates to a property group are automatically reflected in all linked templates. Property bindings. &nbsp;Sometimes, a resource property needs a value found in a property of another resource. For example, a backup server might need the operating system image of the database server that is being backed up, so the database server must exist first. Custom forms. &nbsp;Allows users to design and customize request forms for catalog items, providing a tailored user experience for submitting requests. They can be designed with a drag-and-drop interface and configured with various properties, including conditional logic and external data sources. Custom resources. &nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;supports the use of custom resources within blueprints to extend automation capabilities beyond native resource types. These custom resources are built upon&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;workflows and can represent a resource. When to Use BlueprintsBlueprints allow you to streamline and automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.With blueprints, you can model complex IT services by visually designing infrastructure components like VMs, networks, and storage. You can use blueprints when you want to hide the complexities of the infrastructure provisioning from the end user.You can publish blueprints to the self-service&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;catalog which allows users to request and deploy services based on predefined templates.Best Practices for Designing Blueprints Leverage input properties in blueprints to allow users to customize deployments while maintaining a degree of control. Consider providing default values for required fields to improve user experience and prevent errors. Establish clear and consistent naming conventions for blueprints, catalog items, and other resources to improve manageability and organization. Using an iterative method to build and version blueprints helps teams adopt Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices. Start with a minimum viable blueprint (MVB) and add features iteratively. Additionally, use tools like Git for version vontrol. Sharing Blueprints with Projects and OrganizationsWhen you first create a blueprint, you associate it with a project so that when you publish the blueprint to the catalog, users in the selected project can see request and deploy the blueprint. You have the option of making the published blueprint available to other projects in the organization either when you create the blueprint or at a later time.If you are managing a Provider Consumption organization, you can share blueprints with all other organizations under the same provider administrator or you can select specific organizations. After the blueprint is shared, whenever PCO administrator publishes a blueprint to the catalog, the catalog item is shared with the selected organizations. That means one blueprint backs multiple catalog items, one in each organization.When sharing blueprints with other organizations, consider the following limitations. Blueprints that contain any of the following resource types cannot be shared: property groups; custom resources; secrets; namespaces; VM images from provider tenant content libraries. If a blueprint is shared with an organization, a blueprint version with restrictions cannot be published to the catalog. If a blueprint is not shared with any organizations yet, and it has versions that have restrictions and have been published to the catalog, the blueprint cannot be updated and shared with any organization.

Provider content libraries are available to all organizations on a read-only basis. Providers can create one or more content libraries, each serving a specific need.Organization Content LibrariesOrganization administrators can create and manage their own organization-specific content libraries. Organization content libraries are not accessible to other organizations managed by your provider administrators. Organization content libraries can also subscribe to external content libraries if that option is enabled by the provider administrator.Content Library ConceptsRegions Provider and organization content libraries can be made available to one or more regions in&nbsp; VCF Automation . Provider content libraries are automatically available to all organizations that have quota in given region. Organization-specific content libraries must be explicitly made available to every region where the organization has quota in. Storage Storage consumed by organization content libraries count towards the organization storage quota. Organization content libraries subscribed to external sources use storage allocated to the organizational quota as the remote images are downloaded and stored locally in&nbsp; VCF . This could also lead to increased storage utilization than expected. Sometimes a region may be backed by more than a single vCenter. In such cases, organization content libraries created in such regions may be replicated in each vCenter, leading to higher than expected storage utilization. Check with your provider administrator to understand how this might affect your storage utilization. Namespaces Organization content libraries are generally available to all namespaces created by all projects by default. In some cases, organization administrators might want to create content libraries specific only to a namespace. This is achieved by first turning the toggle&nbsp; Assign to all current and future namespaces &nbsp;to off during the creation of content library. When a new namespace class is created, the organization administrator can add the special content library which makes it available only to namespaces created from this namespace class.

Custom Resources in VCF Automation Blueprints","icon":"","description":"When you create a blueprint in&nbsp;VCF Automation, the resource type palette includes a number of default resource types. You might have use cases where you want to create blueprints based on an expanded list of resource types. You can create custom resource types, add them to the design canvas, and create blueprints that support your design and deployment needs.Before you begin, ensure that a&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;instance is associated with your organization.As an organization administrator, you have two ways to create custom resources. VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;inventory type. &nbsp;You can create custom resources based on existing&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;inventory objects, with or without leveraging the Dynamic Types plug-in for&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator . Dynamic type is required if the desired resource does not exist out-of-the-box in&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;as a SDK inventory object type. You can expose any&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;resource type, be it native, provided by a plug-in in&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator , or created using the Dynamic Types plug-in. New schema . You can define custom resource types that are based on workflows with any kind of input and output. Every input and output becomes part of the schema and its value is shown in the deployment. Because this custom resource type is based on your own custom outputs instead of&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;inventory objects, you must provide a READ workflow in addition to the Create and Delete workflows. You also define what inputs that workflow has. For the Read and Delete workflows, you can map the inputs and outputs to schema properties. This is necessary because the schema property names might not match the input/outputs of the Read and Delete workflows. Custom resource name and resource typeThe custom resource name identifies your custom resource inside the blueprint resource type palette.The resource type of a custom resource must begin with&nbsp;Custom.&nbsp;and each resource type must be unique. Although the inclusion of&nbsp;Custom.&nbsp;is not validated in the text box, the string is automatically added if you remove it.To add custom resources to blueprints, you must activate the custom resource. You can make the custom resource available to blueprints associated with a single project or make it available to all projects.Life cycle actions for custom resourcesYou define the following life cycle actions for your custom resources: ** Create **: this action is called when a deployment is started. ** Read **: this action is used to retrieve the latest state of the deployed resource. The READ workflow is run every few minutes to get the latest status of every provisioned custom resource. You also define what inputs that workflow has, for example, you can just pass the resource ID as an input. The Read action is required only for new schema-based custom resources. ** Destroy **: this action is called when a deployment is deleted. You can edit the&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;workflow associated with your life cycle actions by clicking the&nbsp;Change&nbsp;option for the action.VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;custom resourcesEach&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;custom resource is based on a SDK inventory type and is created by a&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;workflow that has an output which is an instance of your desired SDK type. Primitive types, such as&nbsp;Properties,&nbsp;Date,&nbsp;string, and&nbsp;number&nbsp;are not supported for the creation of custom resource types.SDK object types can be differentiated from other&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;property types by the colon (\":\") used to separate the plug-in name and the type name.You can use the built-in workflows in&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator, or you can create your own. You can create custom resources by clicking on the&nbsp;Resource Definition&nbsp;option in the custom resource editor and selecting&nbsp;Orchestrator inventory type.VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;custom resource inventory typeThe inventory type property defines the type of your custom resource.When you define your custom resource types, you can define the scope of the availability of the select external type. The selected external type can be: Shared across projects. Available only for the selected project. When you select a Create workflow in your custom resource type, the inventory type drop-down appears underneath it. The drop-down includes inventory type properties, that are selected from the output parameters of the&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;workflow. The selected workflow output properties included in the drop-down must be non-array SDK object types such as&nbsp;VC:VirtualMachine.When creating custom workflows that use the dynamic type plug-in, verify that their variables are defined by using the&nbsp;DynamicTypesManager.getObject()&nbsp;method.You can only have one custom resource type with a specific inventory type value per defined scope. For example, if you create a custom resource in your project that uses&nbsp;VC:VirtualMachine&nbsp;as an inventory type, you cannot create another custom resource for the same project that uses the same inventory type. You also cannot create two shared custom resources that use the same inventory type.VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;life cycle action validationWhen you add Create, Destroy, and Read workflows as life cycle actions to your custom resource,&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;validates that the selected workflows have correct input and output property definitions. The&nbsp; Create &nbsp;workflow must have an output parameter that is an SDK object type, such as&nbsp; SSH:Host &nbsp;or&nbsp; SQL:Database . If the selected workflow does not pass the validation, you cannot add Read or Destroy workflows, or save your changes to the custom resource. The Create workflow you select should output the desired type. For the old CR types(based on the Inventory), it is possible to create a deployment with CR by executing the create wf used in the CR as a Catalog item The&nbsp; Destroy &nbsp;workflow must have an input parameter that is an SDK object type that matches the inventory type of the custom resource. The&nbsp; Read &nbsp;workflow must have both an input and output parameter that is an SDK object type that matches the inventory type of the custom resource. Custom resource property schemaYou can edit and view the custom resource properties schema by selecting the&nbsp;Schema Properties&nbsp;tab. The schema includes the name, data type, property type, and, if it is available, the description of a given property. The schema also defines if a specific property is required or optional in the blueprint.When you add&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;workflows to your custom resource, their input and output parameters are added as properties.From this tab, you can also modify and format the properties of your&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator-based custom resources. For example, you can change the display name of a given property, add constraints, or make it read- or write-only for the deployment.When adding constraints to either the item section of array fields or properties section of objects fields in the properties schema, verify that you have validated these constraints as incorrectly applied constraints can cause issues with the custom resource. For example, when adding a maximum constraint to a numbers array, you must verify that this constraint does not break the property's default value.You can edit the property schema for custom resources by navigating to the&nbsp;Schema Properties&nbsp;tab and using either the&nbsp;Code&nbsp;or&nbsp;Form&nbsp;tab. Code : Edit the property schema by using YAML content. When selecting this option, the property schema is defined by using the JSON Schema. Form : Hide non-required and non-computed properties from the schema by clicking&nbsp; Remove Property . Day 2 Operation Custom Request FormsYou can streamline the request form of the day 2 operations included in your custom resource by adding and modifying different types of resource properties.For example, you can bind the value of an input parameter in your request form to an external source, such as a&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;action that retrieves a deployment name or project name. You can also bind the value of a specific input parameter to the computed value of two other text boxes included in the same request form.This functionality is available for both custom resources and resource actions. You can customize the value of the input properties of your request form from the&nbsp;Values&nbsp;tab of the&nbsp;Request Parameters&nbsp;page of the custom resource or resource action editor.Day 2 Operation Request Form ValidationYou can validate the request form of your day 2 operations by adding an external validation. By using an external validation, you prevent the user from submitting the request form until the validation parameters are satisfied. You can add external validation from the&nbsp;Validations&nbsp;tab of the&nbsp;Request Parameters&nbsp;page of the custom resource or resource action editor. After selecting the tab, you can drag an&nbsp;Orchestrator validation&nbsp;element to the canvas and add a&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;action that you want to use for validation.For example, you can create a custom resource that includes a day 2 operation for changing a user password. For such a use case, you can add a&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;action with&nbsp;newPassword&nbsp;and&nbsp;confirmPassword&nbsp;input parameters that use the&nbsp;SecureString&nbsp;type.This is a sample script for validating a user password. For your own use case, you can decide to use a different script.if (newPassword != confirmPassword) { return 'passwords are different';\n}\nif (newPassword.lenght &lt; 7) { return 'password must be at least 10 symbols';\n}\nreturn null;\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_4"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_5"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_6"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_7"}],"links":[],"author":"Volkan Özçelik","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/policy-and-extensibility/managing-custom-resources-in-vcf-automation-blueprints.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766412286732,"modifiedTime":1766412316013,"sourceSize":10183,"sourcePath":"VCF/Control Planes/VCF Automation/Policy and Extensibility/Managing Custom Resources in VCF Automation Blueprints.md","exportPath":"vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/policy-and-extensibility/managing-custom-resources-in-vcf-automation-blueprints.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":139,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/policy-and-extensibility/managing-policies-in-vcf-automation.html":{"title":"Managing Policies in VCF Automation","icon":"","description":"Governance is one of the key aspects of building a cloud-like experience for an organization. In the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;organization portal, application teams can use the self-service catalog and the services console to provision resources depending on their project needs and permissions. As an organization administrator, you can impose guardrails around those provisioning requests. You use&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;policies to enforce the governance through approval workflows and policy templates. Each&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;policy is a set of rules or parameters that are applied to&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;projects to govern deployment requests from application teams, freeing the organization administrator for other tasks.Policy TypesThere are two general categories of policies you can create in&nbsp;VCF Automation: Policies that can be applied to catalog requests. Approval Policy. Approval Policy adds a layer of governance before the requested resources can be deployed, approvers need to provide their acceptance Approval policies control who must approve resource deployment before the request is provisioned.

You can create VPCs for your organization and associate each VPC to one or more namespaces.Each VPC can leverage 3 different types of IP blocks that each have different levels of reachability: Private CIDRs are local to the VPC and require NAT to connect to any resources outside of the VPC. These CIDRs are managed by the VPC administrator and do not need to be unique across multiple VPCs. Transit Gateway (TGW) Private IP blocks are only advertised within the&nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;organization and its TGW. The available IP blocks are defined by the organization administrator. Project administrators can allocate subnets from within the defined IP Blocks for use in their VPCs. These IPs have direct reachability to other VPCs within the organization using the TGW Private IP space. External IP Blocks are managed by the provider administrator. IPs in this space are used for outbound Source NAT to enable external reachability for workloads using Private IPs. Organization administrators can assign subnets within the external IP blocks by the allocations defined by the Provider. You can create a new VPC for each namespace for workloads that require some degree of network separation. If no network separation is required, you can use the same VPC for multiple namespaces.The Network Service can be used to create, update, manage, and delete resources within the VPC by organization administrators and advanced project users.VCF Automation&nbsp;is compatible only with supervisors with NSX VPCs.

A default connectivity profile is configured by the provider administrator to simplify the initial organization configuration. You can provide one or more external and private transit gateway IP address blocks that are used by VPCs configured with a specific connectivity profile.Transit gatewaysDepending on the regional quota, each organization has a transit gateway which provides connectivity to the provider gateway within the organization. One or more VPCs are connected to the transit gateway, and that connection is defined by a VPC connectivity profile. Each VPC has connected workloads and a private subnet. SNAT rules translate addresses from this private subnet to a public address in the IP spaces block. This infrastructure enables the organization and its workloads to connect to external networks.You can view what transit gateways are available to your organization on the&nbsp;Manage &amp; GovernNetworkingTransit Gateways&nbsp;page.You can also manage IP addresses that the provider administrator made available to you and create IP addresses that are specific to your organization.Best Practices for Organization Networking Effectively using VPCs.

Regions are defined and managed by the provider administrator.Zones.&nbsp;A zone represents a vSphere cluster that provides compute, memory, and storage resources for the organization.Region Quota.&nbsp;A region quota defines the compute and storage resources that are allocated to an organization for a given region. The organization can receive quotas from multiple regions. The provider administrator decides from which regions to give a quota to an organization. The region quota can be split across more than one vSphere zone in a region. A region quota includes the following: CPU and memory utilization limits which represent the upper bound of quota in a region. CPU and memory reservations which represent the guaranteed capacity that is allocated in a region. VM classes which represent the T-shirt-sized classes of compute that are available to the organization. Storage classes which represent the storage policies and the quota that is assigned in a region. Resources for Application TeamsResources allocated to the organization in the form of a region quota can be further subdivided and allocated to application teams.Project.&nbsp;Projects are logical representations of users and user groups and the resource pools that those users are entitled to. The resource pools that projects use are called namespaces. Resources, like VMs and Kubernetes clusters, are provisioned on namespaces.Namespace.&nbsp;A vSphere Namespace is a resource pool that comprises CPU, memory, and storage resources that are assigned to projects inVCF Automation. Namespaces derive their quota from the overall region quota of the organization and come with controls such CPU, memory, and storage usage. Each namespace is bound to the scope of the project that it is associated with. Each project can contain multiple namespaces. Because the region quota can be split across multiple vSphere zones, the resource pool of a namespace can also be split across multiple vSphere zones. As an organization administrator, you can configure which zones a namespace can derive its resource limits from.Namespace Class.&nbsp;Namespace classes are templates for defining guardrails on parameters that are used to create a namespace, like CPU limits, storage limits, permissible VM and storage classes, and others. Namespace classes are a prerequisite for creating namespaces. In the namespace class, you can set default values for CPU and memory limits and reservations. If a namespace class has a zone defined, default values for namespace limits and reservations are used from the zone section. As an organization administrator, you create namespace classes that fit your project needs. You can create one or more namespaces using the default namespace classes that come preconfigured in your organization. You can also override those defaults in a given project to suit specific configurations.An example of an organization quota: Region&nbsp; region-one &nbsp;has three vSphere Zones -&nbsp; vs-zone-1 ,&nbsp; vs-zone-2 , and&nbsp; vs-zone-3 . Organization&nbsp; org-1 &nbsp;has a region quota of 25Ghz of CPU in&nbsp; vs-zone-1 &nbsp;and 50GHz of CPU in&nbsp; vs-zone2 &nbsp;for a total quota of 75Ghz of CPU in&nbsp; region-one . Networking ConceptsVPC.&nbsp;Virtual private clouds (VPCs) are the foundational networking element used in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;to enable applications to communicate with each other and the outside world. A VPC provides an isolated domain of networking resources that can be associated with one or more namespaces. As the organization administrator, you create VPCs for your organization. In addition, organization administrators and advanced project users can use the Networking Service in the IaaS Console to create, update, and manage resources within a given VPC.Connectivity Profile.&nbsp;A connectivity profile is a template for VPC configuration. You can provide one or more external and private Transit Gateway IP address blocks that are used by VPCs configured with a specific connectivity profile. When the provider administrator allocates the regional networking configuration to the organization, а default connectivity profile is created. As an organization administrator, you can create additional connectivity profiles to use in your organization.Consumption ConceptsApplication teams can provision resources on a self-service basis in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;using the catalog or the IaaS Services console. The catalog contains blueprints that are curated and maintained by the organization administrator, while cloud services in the IaaS Services console can be accessed directly without blueprints. Both methods of provisioning resources require content libraries that host the images.Blueprints and Catalog.&nbsp;Blueprints are infrastructure templates that define the resources and cloud services you want to create to run an application. Organization administrators create the blueprints and publish them as catalog items for end users. End users interact with form entries of catalog items to request resources. These forms can be customized to hide unnecessary fields or to create dynamic entries.Self-service IaaS Console.&nbsp;The self-service IaaS Services Console in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;allows users to provision cloud services directly on namespaces from the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;user interface, the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;APIs, and CLIs without the need for blueprints and the catalog.Content Library.&nbsp;Content libraries host VM images that application teams use when deploying resources. Organizations can either use content libraries that are provided by the provider administrator or create their own organization-specific content libraries.Policies.&nbsp;Policies provide governance on resources like VMs and VKS clusters that are provisioned from cloud services. Policies can be applied to the whole organization or to individual projects.&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;supports two types of policies: Policies that are applied to resources provisioned from the catalog, such as Approval, Day 2, and Lease policies. Policies that are applied to resources provisioned through the self-service IaaS console.

The system administrator does not allocate infrastructure to your organization. Add your cloud vendor accounts. Determine which regions or datastores are the cloud zones that you want your developers deploying to. Create projects that group the developers with the cloud zones. Create policies that define the cloud zones. As a&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;for VM Apps administrator, you must understand the user roles and set up connections with your cloud account vendor and integration applications. When you configure the cloud accounts and integrations, you are configuring the communication between&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;and those target systems.VCF Automation&nbsp;also provides a single point where you can request and manage catalog items. The catalog is the simplified user interface that cloud administrators make available to users when the administrator's teams do not need full access to developing and building the templates. You use the catalog to deploy templates to cloud regions or datastores associated with projects.As a cloud administrator, you create catalog items by importing released&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;templates and Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates that your users can deploy to your cloud vendor regions or datastores. Your users can then request and monitor the provisioning process. After deployment, users can manage the deployed catalog items throughout the deployment lifecycle.How to use&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;for VM Apps user interfaceAn overview of&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;for VM Apps includes the following basic functions. The&nbsp; Home &nbsp;tab shows a summary of your resources, deployments, and other inventory currently managed by&nbsp; VCF Automation , as well as pending notifications and action items. This tab is available to administrators only. The&nbsp; Consume &nbsp;tab shows the current status of your provisioned, discovered, onboarded, and other resources. You can access resource details and day 2 actions that you use to manage your resources. The&nbsp; Design &nbsp;tab is your development home. You use the canvas and the YAML editor to develop and then deploy your machines and applications. The&nbsp; Infrastructure &nbsp;tab is where you add and organize your cloud vendor resources and users. This tab also provides information about deployed blueprints. The&nbsp; Content and Policies &nbsp;tab is where you import content to the catalog and create policies to manage deployments. The&nbsp; Extensibility &nbsp;tab is where you can extend and automate your application life cycles. You can subscribe to events that are used to trigger extensibility actions or&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;workflows. The&nbsp; Orchestrator &nbsp;tab is where you access your&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;integration. You use&nbsp; VCF Operations orchestrator &nbsp;to build and run workflows that extend automation capabilities. An&nbsp; Alerts &nbsp;tab provides notifications regarding capacity, performance, and availability for your infrastructure resources. You must have a configured integration with&nbsp; VCF Operations &nbsp;to see and use the alerts. The&nbsp; Inbox &nbsp;tab is where you approve catalog requests and respond to deployments that request user input. As an organization administrator&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;for VM Apps, you must understand the user roles and set up connections with your cloud account vendor and integration applications. When you configure the cloud accounts and integrations, you are configuring the communication between&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;and those target systems.You configure your cloud infrastructure to support template development and deployment. The infrastructure begins with cloud vendors, then you add&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;users as project members and link them to the cloud account regions as projects. At this point, you can continue to develop templates, or you can turn over development to the project administrators and members.As a project member, use&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;as you iteratively develop and deploy templates, until you have a production-worthy product. The deployment locations are configured by your cloud administrator as part of the infrastructure. The administrator has the best understanding of your organizations resources and budget.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"}],"links":[],"author":"Volkan Özçelik","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/tenancy-and-access-control/organization-management/managing-organizations-for-vm-apps-in-vcf-automation.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766415135891,"modifiedTime":1766415191151,"sourceSize":5921,"sourcePath":"VCF/Control Planes/VCF Automation/Tenancy and Access Control/Organization Management/Managing Organizations for VM Apps in VCF Automation.md","exportPath":"vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/tenancy-and-access-control/organization-management/managing-organizations-for-vm-apps-in-vcf-automation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":150,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"vcf/control-planes/vcf-automation/tenancy-and-access-control/organization-management/managing-projects-in-vcf-automation.html":{"title":"Managing Projects in VCF Automation","icon":"","description":"Projects in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;organizations provide a logical grouping of users and the infrastructure that they are assigned. Projects are used to represent real world teams which are in charge of development or operations. Each project has one or more namespaces assigned to it. Each namespace is an envelope of resources where applications can be deployed. Access controls for projects are governed by pre-defined roles.Project ConceptsNamespaces and Projects.&nbsp;Organization administrators can create and attach one or more namespaces to a project. Administrators can also delete a namespace at any time, which dissociates the namespace from the project. Every organization comes with a default project. The default project doesn’t have users or namespaces. The organization administrator can change the name, description of the default project, and add users and namespaces to the default project.Namespace Class.&nbsp;A namespace class is a template that is used to create namespaces. All components of a namespace, including limits on CPU, memory, and storage utilization, VM classes and storage classes, and content libraries can be defined as a reusable template. Namespace classes are created and maintained by organization administrators.Namespaces and Resource Limits.&nbsp;Infrastructure quota assigned to an organization can be subdivided and assigned to project teams in the form of namespaces. Namespaces are isolated resource pools in which resources like VMs, VKS clusters, and volumes can be provisioned. Organization administrators can override the resource limits specified in a namespace class during namespace creation.Namespaces and Zones.&nbsp;The resource limits of a namespace can be satisfied from capacity in one or more vSphere zones. When creating a namespace, organization administrators can select wich zones the namespace can use.Namespaces and Organization Quotas.&nbsp;Namespaces count towards the organization quota. The sum total of resource limits of all created namespaces cannot exceed the organization quota.Best Practices for ProjectsHow many projects and namespaces you create depends on your organization needs. Projects . Multiple projects are used when isolation boundaries between project teams are required. Only project members can access deployments and resources available to a project. Fewer projects are desired when isolation requirements can be traded off for a simpler operating model. Namespaces . Multiple namespaces are used when strict resource limits are needed for each application. Namespaces are logical constructs that can be used to define application boundaries. Each application can be deployed on a namespace with prescribed resource limits for CPU, memory, and storage. For instance, a group of VMs and VKS clusters that make up an application can be logically grouped together in a namespace.

Each organization operates in a secure and isolated environment where users can access only allocated services and resources. Organizations consume resources and cloud services from a shared pool of resources. The resources allocated to organizations can be further allocated to application teams which are modeled in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;as projects. Organizations have users with varying levels of permissions depending on their role and duties.Organizations in&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;are created by the provider administrator in the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;Provider Management Portal. The provider administrator can create two types of organizations: an All Apps organization and a VM Apps organization. VM Apps organizations can run VM-based applications, while All Apps organizations are enabled to run a comprehensive set of built-in cloud services.

All Apps organizations are used when organizations are ready to leverage the comprehensive set of built-in cloud services to provision VMs, Kubernetes, and so on. The underlying infrastructure requires vSphere Supervisor clusters and is managed in the&nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;Provider Management Portal. Talk to your provider administrator about how you can leverage these capabilities. VM Apps organizations are intended for current users of VMware Aria Automation who want to continue their journey with minimal disruptions. The VM Apps organization is fully self-contained with built-in infrastructure management and consumption capabilities. When to use blueprints vs the IaaS self-service console? Blueprints and the catalog offer a controlled manner to build and curate infrastructure. They are prescriptive in terms of the provisioned resources and so are suitable to deploy applications in production. They are also suitable for end users who do not want to concern themselves with details of the infrastructure. The IaaS self-service console offers more flexibility and is more suitable for development purposes.

These different levels control access to the organization, the projects that produce or consume the blueprints, catalog items, access to IaaS services, and the ability for users to use or see individual parts of the user interface. These different levels give organization administrators different tools to apply any level of granularity that is required by their operational needs.As the organization administrator, after you configure an identity provider for your organization, you can import users and groups and manage their role assignments using the&nbsp;Access Control&nbsp;page. There are two types of predefined roles in&nbsp;VCF Automation: organization roles and project roles. In addition, you can create custom roles for specific use cases.Predefined Organization RolesThe organization roles are global.

For detailed information on the OpenID Connect standard, see&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html\" target=\"_self\">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>.As an identity provider proxy server,&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;acts as intermediary between the client application (relying party) and the identity provider, and delegates actual authentication to the respective authentication mechanism used by the provider or tenants.A&nbsp;system administrator&nbsp;can configure relying parties that integrate with&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;and then enable individual organizations to allow their users to use&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;as an identity provider proxy.When making browser-based requests to the&nbsp;/oidc&nbsp;endpoints, the default behavior is for browser pages to be loaded from the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;host. To use OIDC, you can also configure a non-VCF Automation&nbsp;host into the CORS filtering list.Authentication FlowIntegration with&nbsp;VCF Automation<br>&nbsp;is implemented through the OAuth 2.0 OIDC authorization code flow standard. For detailed information, see&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth\" target=\"_self\">Authentication using the Authorization Code Flow</a>.When a relying party redirects a user to&nbsp;VCF Automation, if there is no existing client session, the user is prompted to log in to&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;by first identifying the organization or provider portal they wish to log into. The user authenticates through the configured authentication mechanism, which may involve further redirections to external identity providers. If the user's browser detects an existing&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;user session, the authentication flow provides an SSO experience and no user interaction is required for reauthentication. Upon successful completion of the process,&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;returns an access token and an ID token. The authorization code that is issued as part of the flow is valid for 5 minutes. The access token is valid for 5 minutes, and the ID token is valid for an hour.You cannot use the access token that&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;returns upon successful authentication for accessing the UI portals or for making regular&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;API calls.ID Token DetailsThe ID token that&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;returns contains the following OpenID standard claims and&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;specific claims.OpenID Request ScopesThe scope of the OpenID request is used to specify the privileges requested for an access token.Endpoints\n<br>\nYou can use the access token returned by&nbsp; VCF Automation &nbsp;to retrieve claims about the authenticated user at the&nbsp; hostname /oidc/UserInfo &nbsp;endpoint.

Depending on the type of workflow that you are developing, you might follow a different sequence of step or skip a step. For example, you can create a workflow without custom scripting.Generally, developing a workflow involves the following steps. Create a new workflow or create a duplicate of an existing workflow from the standard library. Provide general information about the workflow. Define the input and output parameters of the workflow. Lay out and link the workflow schema to define the logical flow of the workflow. Bind the input and output parameters of each schema element to workflow variables. Write the necessary scripts for scriptable task elements or custom decision elements. Create the workflow presentation from the&nbsp; Input Form &nbsp;tab. Validate the workflow. Practices for developing workflowsYou can follow best practices for developing Orchestrator workflows by multiple users and in a clustered environment. Each developer has a dedicated test standalone Orchestrator instance for creating and developing workflows. As VCF Automation can only have single Orchestrator instance integrated to it, this should be a separate standalone instance. Workflows are saved as maven projects on a shared source code control system. To ensure optimal performance of the Orchestrator production deployment, it is best to import workflows in a scheduled period. Working with the workflow editorYou create and edit workflows in the Orchestrator workflow editor. The workflow editor is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;for developing workflows.The workflow editor consists of tabs where you edit the components of your workflows. Summary. Provide general information about the workflow, such as the workflow name, description, tags, and version number. The Summary tab can also be used to configure the server restart behavior and workflow run failure behavior. Variables. Define the variables for your workflow. Variables were previously known as attributes. Input/Output. Define the input and output parameters of your workflow. The input parameters provide the data that the workflow processes during the workflow run. The output parameters are provided when the workflow run finishes. Schema. Build your workflow by dragging workflow schema elements from the workflow palette on the left side of the Schema tab. By clicking an element in the schema diagram, you can define and edit the element's behavior. Input Form. Define the layout of the user input dialog box that appears when users run a workflow. You arrange the parameters and variables into presentation steps and tabs to ease identification of parameters in the input parameters dialog box. You define the constraints on the input parameters that users can provide in the presentation by setting the parameter properties. You can also add external validation for your workflow by using actions. Version History. View and manage the version history of the workflow. Compare and restore versions and push and pull workflows to and from your integrated Git repository. Audit. View information about events related to the workflow such as, when it was saved, when a workflow run was performed, and when a workflow run was finished.

An input parameter is an argument that the workflow processes when it runs. The user, an application, another workflow, or an action passes input parameters to a workflow for the workflow to process when it runs.For example, if a workflow resets a virtual machine, the workflow requires the name of the virtual machine as an input parameter.Output ParametersA workflow's output parameters represent the result from the workflow run. Output parameters can change when a workflow or a workflow element runs. During a workflow run, the workflow can receive the output parameters of other workflows as input parameters.For example, if a workflow creates a snapshot of a virtual machine, the output parameter for the workflow is the resulting snapshot.Workflow VariablesWorkflow elements process data that they receive as input parameters, and set the resulting data as workflow variables or output parameters.Read-only workflow variables act as global constants for a workflow. Writable variables act as a workflow’s global variables.You can use variables to transfer data between the elements of a workflow. You can obtain variables in the following ways: Define variables when you create a workflow. Set the output parameter of a workflow element as a workflow variable. Inherit variables from a configuration element. Workflow SchemaA workflow schema is a graphical representation that shows the workflow as a flow diagram of interconnected workflow elements. The workflow schema is the most important element of a workflow as it determines its logic.Workflow PresentationWhen users run a workflow, they provide the values for the input parameters of the workflow in the workflow presentation. When you organize the workflow presentation, consider the type and number of input parameters of the workflow. You can configure the presentation of your workflows from the Input Form tab of the workflow editor.Workflow TokensA workflow token represents a workflow that is running or has finished running.A workflow is an abstract description of a process that defines a generic sequence of steps and a generic set of required input parameters. When you run a workflow with a set of input parameters, you receive an instance of this abstract workflow that behaves according to the specific input parameters you give it. This specific instance of a finished or a running workflow is called a workflow token.Workflow Token AttributesWorkflow token attributes are the specific parameters with which a workflow token runs. The workflow token attributes are an aggregation of the workflow's global variables and the specific input and output parameters with which you run the workflow token.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_4"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_5"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_6"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_7"}],"links":[],"author":"Volkan Özçelik","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/key-workflow-concepts.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766415570981,"modifiedTime":1766415593730,"sourceSize":3397,"sourcePath":"VCF/Control Planes/VCF Operations/Platform Operations and Services/Platform Services and Management/Key Workflow Concepts.md","exportPath":"vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/key-workflow-concepts.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":187,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/platform-operations-and-services/platform-services-and-management/running-vcf-operations-orchestrator-workflows.html":{"title":"Running VCF Operations Orchestrator Workflows","icon":"","description":"A&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;workflow runs according to a logical flow of events.When you run a workflow, each schema element in the workflow runs according to the following sequence.

Workflows perform tasks such as provisioning virtual machines, backing up, performing regular maintenance, sending emails, performing SSH operations, managing the physical infrastructure, and other general utility operations. Workflows accept inputs according to their function. You can create workflows that run according to defined schedules, or that run if certain anticipated events occur. Information can be provided by you, by other users, by another workflow or action, or by an external process such as a Web service call from an application. Workflows perform some validation and filtering of information before they run.Workflows can call upon other workflows. For example, you can have workflow that calls up another workflow to create a new virtual machine.You create workflows by using the&nbsp;VCF Operations orchestrator&nbsp;interface’s integrated development environment (IDE), that provides access to the workflow library and the ability to run workflows on the workflow engine.

It combines the power of VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) with VCF’s operational tooling to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations.Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.<br>HCX stands for Hybrid Cloud eXtension—it’s not just another name for <a data-href=\"vMotion\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">vMotion</a>. It’s a comprehensive application mobility platform from VMware that enables workload migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.VCF Operations HCX has the following capabilities:\nSeamless workload migration. Migrate VMs and applications in waves live or in bulk with minimal or zero downtime.\nNetwork extension. Extend networks while preserving IP addresses and topologies to maintain application connectivity.\nInter-and intra-VCF mobility. Enable workload mobility within and across multiple&nbsp;VCF instances, including site-to-site and region-to-region migrations.\nApplication placement optimization. Enables high-performance application mobility across different environments, making it easier to optimize workload placement based on business requirements.\nAt its heart, VCF Operations HCX is an application mobility platform that:\n**Connects environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—with optimized, secure network interconnectivity.\nEnables workload migration—live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) and applications between environments with minimal downtime.\nSupports hybrid cloud adoption—making it easier to modernize, consolidate, or balance workloads across sites.\nEssentially, it extends the capabilities of VCF so that moving workloads into, out of, or around your VCF estate is seamless and automated.VCF Operations HCX automates the process of moving VMs and applications from one environment to another. This includes:\nLive migrations (zero or near-zero downtime)\nBulk migrations for large-scale moves\nCross-platform migrations (including non-vSphere sources in some scenarios)\nNetwork extension so IPs/MACs remain consistent during migration\nThis makes migrations faster, less error-prone, and less disruptive than traditional approaches.HCX builds a secure, encrypted interconnect between sites that:\nExtends Layer-2 networks across sites\nPreserves VM networking so that workloads keep their addresses\nProvides optimized tunnels tailored for high-speed bulk movement\nCloud adoption isn’t a one-time event — usage patterns change. HCX enables:\nMoving workloads based on performance needs\nRebalancing for cost or compliance reasons\nContinuous optimization of where workloads run\nThis is key in hybrid environments where business needs or performance requirements evolve over time.VCF Operations HCX has deeper integration with VCF:\nUnified management &amp; single sign-on with other VCF components\nShared licensing managed through VCF Operations\nIntegrated planning &amp; execution workflows with VCF Operations for Networks\nEasier deployment with a single unified HCX Manager appliance\nThat means less separate manual setup and a smoother experience from discovery to execution.Imagine you’re relocating a city’s services (libraries, police stations, hospitals) to a new smart city:\nTraditional migration = manually moving each building piece by piece.\nVCF Operations HCX = building a dedicated transit corridor where services can shift live without interruption, while preserving all their connections and addresses — all orchestrated by a central operations dashboard instead of manual labor.\n<br>vMotion is VMware’s native live-migration technology for moving a running VM between <a data-href=\"ESX\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ESX</a> hosts (including memory and CPU state), usually within the same <a data-href=\"VCF Domain\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/vcf-domain.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Domain</a> or cluster.HCX doesn’t replace vMotion; it leverages it as one migration method (called “HCX vMotion”) when moving workloads between HCX-connected sites. It also supports:\nCold Migration: Powered-off VMs\nBulk Migration: Parallel, batched workloads\nReplication-Assisted vMotion: Parallel live migrations via replication + vMotion\nSo, vMotion is a component inside HCX’s larger orchestration and connectivity framework. VCF Operations HCX is VMware’s integrated workload mobility solution within VMware Cloud Foundation.\nIt simplifies application migration and workload rebalancing across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.\nVia optimized network extension and interconnects, it preserves application connectivity and minimizes disruption.\nRecent integrations with VCF improve deployment, management, and operational workflows.\nIf you want, I can explain specific HCX migration types or dive into how this works step-by-step during a VCF rollout.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Core Concept","level":2,"id":"Core_Concept_0"},{"heading":"What Does “VCF Operations HCX” Do","level":2,"id":"What_Does_“VCF_Operations_HCX”_Do_0"},{"heading":"1.

a network administrator for networking and automation for virtual machines, containers, or bare metal applications.NSX enables network connectivity, operations, and scale. It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp;Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture.Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.

As a vSphere administrator, you create and configure&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces&nbsp;through the vSphere Client.When initially created, a&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;has unlimited resources within the&nbsp;Supervisor. As a vSphere administrator, you can set limits for CPU, memory, storage, as well as the number of Kubernetes objects that can run within the&nbsp;vSphere Namespace. Storage limitations are represented as storage quotas in Kubernetes. A resource pool is created in vSphere per each&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;on the&nbsp;SupervisorYou can map up to three&nbsp;vSphere Zones&nbsp;to a&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;for running workloads on them. The&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;spreads across all vSphere clusters that are part of the&nbsp;vSphere Zones. The resources utilized to a&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;are taken from all the underlying vSphere clusters on equal parts.

You should not confuse a&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;with a Kubernetes namespace.A&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;is implemented as an extension to a vSphere resource pool and its function is to provide resources to workloads running in the&nbsp;Supervisor. A&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;has a direct mapping to a Kubernetes namespace through which object and storage quotas are enforced upon workloads.Another difference with a regular Kubernetes namespace is that the vSphere administrator manages the user access to&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces, as mentioned from above. The vSphere administrator can also associate VM classes and Content Libraries containing VM templates that DevOps engineers can use to self-service VMs.These are not Kubernetes namespaces in the usual sense.\nThey are:\nResource-governed containers\nBacked by: <br>vSphere Networking (<a data-href=\"NSX\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/nsx/nsx.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">NSX</a>)\n<br>vSphere Storage (<a data-href=\"vSAN\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsan/vsan.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">vSAN</a>)\nvSphere RBAC A tenant can have more than one Supervisor Namespace; however, those namespaces are not individual tenants.\nTenancy is a business/trust concept.

Organizations offer a centralized structure for billing, access control, and resource sharing, facilitating collaboration and governance across teams and departments. The organization typically correlates to a business or possibly a line of business within a large enterprise. Under the organization are grouping objects that allow you to separate the concerns of the people that use your resources.VCF Automation&nbsp;ProjectsProjects are logical representations of application teams and consist of users, groups, and resource pools they are entitled to. Projects enable you to organize your&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;clusters into logical groupings, for example, to align with business units.However, projects are also tied to the underlying infrastructure. The resource pools that projects use are called&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces. You can add or remove namespaces to a project at any time. Clusters within the same&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;cannot be in different projects. Also, you cannot move a cluster between different&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces.By combining your resources into projects, you can simplify management. For example, you can apply policies or perform batch operations at the project level instead of working with separate clusters.Since you can change the name of a project at any time,&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management uses the project ID as the unique identifier for all project-scoped resources.You cannot delete a project if it contains a&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster.VKS&nbsp;ClustersA&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster is a vSphere-based Kubernetes cluster that runs your workloads.For more information about&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;and&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;clusters, see the&nbsp;Managing vSphere Kubernetes Service with vSphere Supervisor&nbsp;documentation.VKS&nbsp;Cluster NamespacesEach&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster can have one or multiple Kubernetes namespaces that you can view with&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management. Your&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;clusters can also have unmanaged namespaces. Unmanaged namespaces are namespaces that are created externally and that you do not manage with&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management.VKS&nbsp;cluster namespaces are different from&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces. A&nbsp;vSphere Namespace&nbsp;is a resource pool that comprises CPU, memory, and storage resources that the provider administrator allocates to organizations and projects in&nbsp;VCF Automation. You do not manage&nbsp;vSphere Namespaces&nbsp;through&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management.Synchronization of Organizations and Projects From&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;to&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;Cluster ManagementUpon deployment,&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management subscribes to the&nbsp;VCF Automation&nbsp;event broker service to synchronize organizations and projects. After subscribing to event broker, you get an event every time an organization or a project changes. This way&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management remains in sync with&nbsp;VCF Automation. For any events that might get missed, there is also a regular periodic re-synchronization.VKS&nbsp;cluster management is not available for VM Apps organizations in&nbsp;VCF Automation. Those organizations and the projects in them do not get sychronized with&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management.

They are part of the VCF Automation control plane, not part of kube-apiserver for the VKS clusters. This means these constructs are not visible via kubectl against a VKS cluster as CRs like PlatformMetaData or similar. Analogy:\nThink of Organization/Project as resource containers in a cloud control plane (like AWS Organizations + Accounts). Kubernetes doesn’t know or enforce them — but the cloud control plane does. Similarly here: VCF Automation knows about Organization and Projects, but the VKS clusters themselves do not expose that model in their own Kubernetes API surface.It’s important to separate three different namespace domains:These are the namespaces you see when you do:kubectl get ns<br>inside a VKS workload cluster — this is “real native Kubernetes” and works exactly like any other cluster namespace (pods, services, roles, etc.). <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://williamlam.com/2025/08/ms-a2-vcf-9-0-lab-configuring-vsphere-kubernetes-service-vks.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://williamlam.com/2025/08/ms-a2-vcf-9-0-lab-configuring-vsphere-kubernetes-service-vks.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_self\">WilliamLam.com</a>These do not represent Organization/Project boundaries from VCF Automation — they are just Kubernetes namespaces in the workload cluster.The vSphere Supervisor cluster also has namespaces — these are used to scope: System components (for VKS, VM Service, etc.) Resource allocation pools Workload provisioning contexts You can see Supervisor namespaces via:kubectl get namespaces<br>when connected to the Supervisor cluster’s control plane API endpoint. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mpoore.io/posts/2024/an-introduction-to-vsphere-supervisor-and-vsphere-kubernetes-service-vks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mpoore.io/posts/2024/an-introduction-to-vsphere-supervisor-and-vsphere-kubernetes-service-vks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_self\">mpoore.io</a>These Supervisor namespaces are used as a container for VKS cluster objects — but again, this is not the same as the VCF Automation Organization/Project construct.

Org, Project, ownership Quotas Policies Approval flows RBAC mappings Lifecycle intent (“this cluster belongs to Project X in Org Y”) This layer is authoritative for that metadata.This is the service that provisions and manages Kubernetes clusters on the Supervisor.VKS: receives instructions does not reason about “organizations” as a first-class concept enforces what it is told via concrete config This is the execution substrate: namespaces resource pools networking storage controllers It enforces mechanics, not business structure.The Org / Project info is used to derive concrete, enforceable artifacts before or around the cluster — not inside it.Here’s how that plays out.When you say (implicitly or explicitly):\n“Create a VKS cluster in Project A of Organization B”\nVCF Automation uses that metadata to decide: Which Supervisor Namespace the cluster is created under Which resource pools (CPU/mem/storage) it may consume Which networks it may attach to Which policies apply by default By the time VKS sees the request, it looks more like:\n“Create a cluster with these limits, in this namespace, using these credentials”\nSo VKS never sees “Organization = FooCorp” —\nit sees resolved, concrete constraints.Org / Project metadata drives policies such as: max node count allowed VM classes allowed storage policies network isolation rules upgrade windows These are compiled down into: admission constraints Supervisor namespace settings cluster spec defaults lifecycle rules enforced externally Once compiled, VKS enforces the result, not the intent.Org / Project membership is used to decide: who can create / delete clusters who can resize them who can see them in UI / API But inside the cluster: Kubernetes RBAC is still Kubernetes RBAC there is no native concept of “Org Admin” or “Project Owner” Those roles are translated at provisioning time into: kubeconfigs initial role bindings access paths Again: translation → enforcement → forget the original label.Because the Org / Project model is authoritative: deleting a Project can trigger cluster deletion quota exhaustion can block scale-out org-level policy changes can trigger reconciliation But: the decision happens in VCF Automation VKS just executes lifecycle operations it is told to execute This is why you see eventing / synchronization mentioned in the docs:\nit’s about state reconciliation, not metadata propagation.This is the part you were circling around — and your instinct was right.Inside a VKS workload cluster: ❌ No Organization CR ❌ No Project CR ❌ No PlatformMetadata object ❌ No way to kubectl get and discover: “Which Org do I belong to?” From a DevOps or in-cluster perspective:\nThe cluster is sovereign.\nIt has: nodes namespaces workloads policies But no awareness of who “owns” it at the platform governance layer.This is very intentional.If Org / Project metadata were injected into clusters: cluster portability would suffer backup / restore would leak tenancy info federation would get messy GitOps would become environment-coupled By keeping the metadata out-of-band: clusters remain generic Kubernetes governance stays centralized enforcement happens at the edges (creation, mutation, deletion) This mirrors how: AWS Organizations ≠ Kubernetes namespaces vCenter folders ≠ VM guest OS awareness Cloud billing ≠ workload runtime VCF Automation owns intent.\nVKS enforces outcome.\nSupervisor executes mechanics.\nOnce the outcome is materialized, the intent is no longer visible downstream. Does the metadata exist?\nYes — in VCF Automation. Is it synchronized into the cluster?\nNo — only its effects are. Can DevOps see it via kubectl?\nNo — by design. Does the Supervisor know about Orgs/Projects?\nNo — only namespaces, pools, and policies. VKS does not “use” Org / Project metadata at runtime.\nIt receives decisions derived from that metadata and enforces them.\nThe metadata itself never enters the Kubernetes API surface.\n<br><a href=\"./https://vcf.wtf?query=tag:todo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#todo\">#todo</a> TODO: figure this out.<br>\n<a data-href=\"VKS Cluster Management\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/kubernetes-runtimes/vks/vks-cluster-management/vks-cluster-management.html#_4\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VKS Cluster Management</a> is a component, I think.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_4"},{"heading":"1.

When a&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster is attached to&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management, the&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;auto-attach service installs a set of extensions and cluster resource definitions to the cluster nodes.The agents configuration contains information about the correct&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management endpoint, the image registry that provides the images, and the proxy configuration.Cluster HealthThe overall health of a cluster is an aggregation of the health of the components and nodes in the cluster.The health status of the cluster can be one of the following values: Healthy A cluster is healthy when all nodes and components are healthy, and a heartbeat for the cluster is received every minute. Unhealthy A cluster is unhealthy if either of the following is reported as unhealthy: One or more of the cluster’s control plane nodes One or more of the cluster’s components Warning A cluster can have a warning status if any of its worker nodes are in an unhealthy or unknown state. A cluster can also have a warning status if any nodes (worker or control plane) are in a warning state. Unknown The health status of a cluster in unknown if either of the following is reported as unknown: One or more of the cluster’s control plane nodes One or more of the cluster’s components Disconnected A cluster is considered disconnected if no heartbeat is received from the cluster for more than 3 minutes. Node HealthThe information received for a node consists of the&nbsp;NodeReady&nbsp;condition, and a number of other conditions like&nbsp;MemoryPressure,&nbsp;DiskPressure, and&nbsp;OutOfDisk.&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management uses the value of these conditions to discover the health of the node. The status of each condition is assumed to be unchanged until the node reports a change.Based on the reported conditions, the health status of a node can be one of the following: Healthy If&nbsp; NodeReady &nbsp;is&nbsp; True &nbsp;and all other conditions are healthy, the node is healthy. Unhealthy The node is unhealthy if&nbsp; NodeReady &nbsp;is&nbsp; False . The node is also unhealthy if&nbsp; NodeReady &nbsp;is&nbsp; True , but more than half of the other conditions are in an unhealthy state. Warning The warning status indicates that&nbsp; NodeReady &nbsp;is&nbsp; True , and less than half of the other conditions are in an unhealthy state. Unknown If&nbsp; NodeReady &nbsp;has any value other than&nbsp; True &nbsp;or&nbsp; False , the health status of the node is&nbsp; Unknown . The node can also have an unknown status if&nbsp; VKS &nbsp;cluster management receives no heartbeat from the cluster for more than three minutes. Component HealthVKS&nbsp;cluster management monitors the health of the following components running in the cluster: The&nbsp; kube-apiserver The&nbsp; scheduler The&nbsp; controller-manager One or more&nbsp; etcd &nbsp;components ( etcd-0 ,&nbsp; etcd-1 ,&nbsp; etcd-2 , and so on) The component status event reports the&nbsp;Healthy&nbsp;condition for each of these components every 45 seconds.The health status of each component can be one of the following: Healthy If the last reported value of the&nbsp; Healthy &nbsp;condition of the component is&nbsp; True , the component is&nbsp; Healthy . Unhealthy If the last reported value of the&nbsp; Healthy &nbsp;condition of the component is&nbsp; False , the component is&nbsp; Unhealthy .

Out of these five policies, only the quota policy type is implemented by using the Kubernetes-native&nbsp;ResourceQuota&nbsp;objects,. The rest of the policy types use the open-source OPA Gatekeeper as the policy engine.You can apply policies at any level of the hierarchy - the organization, the project, or cluster levels.Policy InheritanceIn the&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management resource hierarchy, there are three levels at which you can create policies: Organization Project VKS &nbsp;cluster You can create direct policies at any level. But policies are also propagated down the hierarchy tree. Every object inherits the policies defined for its parent objects. For example, when you create a security policy at the project level, all clusters within that project inherit the applicable policy. Additionally, the project also inherits policy definitions from its parent organization, if there are policies created and applied to that organization.VKS&nbsp;Cluster Management Policies and GatekeeperSome of the policy types in&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management are implemented using OPA Gatekeeper. These policy types include security policy, image registry policy, and mutation policy. When you implement one of these policies,&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management installs Gatekeeper on the cluster and maintains that installation while you have&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management policies applied to that cluster.If there is an installation of Gatekeeper on the cluster that was not installed by&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management , then&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management does not alter or maintain that installation. In many cases, this situation does not impact the functionality of the policy. However, because Gatekeeper was not installed and configured by&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management , Gatekeeper-based policies implemented through&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management might not function as expected. This situation raises an&nbsp;Incompatibility&nbsp;insight that can be viewed on the&nbsp;Policy Insights&nbsp;page.For best results, if you are using&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster management policies on a cluster, remove external installations of Gatekeeper and let&nbsp;VKS<br>&nbsp;cluster management manage Gatekeeper for you.

A module that is responsible for deploying and running stand-alone VMs and VMs that make up&nbsp; VKS &nbsp;clusters. Spherelet. An additional process called Spherelet is created on each host. It is a kubelet that is ported natively to ESX and allows the ESX host to become part of the Kubernetes cluster. Container Runtime Executive (CRX) component. CRX is similar to a VM from the perspective of Hostd and&nbsp; vCenter . CRX includes a paravirtualized Linux kernel that works together with the hypervisor. CRX uses the same hardware virtualization techniques as VMs and it has a VM boundary around it. A direct boot technique is used, which allows the Linux guest of CRX to initiate the main init process without passing through kernel initialization.

Some applications and objects might use transient fast storage, while others require storage that persists.Storage Topologies for vSphere ZonesA vSphere Zone is a fault domain that can fail independently from another zones.&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;supports different storage topologies for zones. These topologies define how datastores are attached to&nbsp;ESX&nbsp;hosts and how they behave during zone failures.Zonal datastoreA zonal datastore is local to a single vSphere Zone. It is attached to all the&nbsp;ESX&nbsp;hosts that are part of the underlying cluster. It can replicate data to provide higher availability within the zone. Its availability depends on the zone. If the zone goes down, the zonal datastore also goes down. Examples of a zonal datatore include: non-stretched vSAN, non-stretched vSAN storage cluster, non-stretched VMFS or NFS external storage. Cross-zonal datastoreA cross-zonal datastore spans multiple vSphere Zones. It is attached to&nbsp;ESX&nbsp;hosts from all the zones it covers. It can be stretched storage, for example, stretched vSAN, or non-stretched storage that pools hosts from multiple zones, for example, non-stretched vSAN storage cluster. It typically replicates data across zones. It stays available if one of the zones goes down. Examples of a cross-zonal datastore: stretched vSAN, stretched vSAN storage cluster, metro storage cluster, non-stretched vSAN or vSAN storage cluster deployed from hosts across multiple zones. When you work with zonal and cross-zonal datastores in&nbsp;Supervisor, avoid the following misconfigurations: A zonal datastore is attached to other zones. Example: A zonal vSAN datastore in Zone 1 is attached to Zone 2 and Zone 3 using vSAN remote datastore. A zonal datastore is only partially attached to&nbsp; ESX &nbsp;hosts in the zone. Example: A vSphere administrator accidentally unmounts a datastore from a host. Example: A new host is added to the zone, but the administrator forgets to attach all zonal datastores to it. A cross-zonal datastore is only partially attached to&nbsp; ESX &nbsp;hosts in multiple zones. Example: A datastore is accidentally unmounted from one of the hosts. Example: A new host is added to a zone, but the administrator forgets to attach all cross-zonal datastores to it. Editing storage policies to switch between zonal and cross-zonal compatibility. This action changes the storage class behavior and affects DevOps. Storage policies that match both zonal and cross-zonal datastores. DevOps cannot tell whether the volume they are getting is zonal or cross-zonal. About Storage PoliciesSupervisor&nbsp;uses storage policies to integrate with storage available in your vSphere environment. The policies represent datastores and manage storage placement of such components and objects as control plane VMs,&nbsp;vSphere Pod&nbsp;ephemeral disks, and container images. You might also need policies for storage placement of persistent volumes and VM content libraries. If you use&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;clusters, the storage policies also dictate how the&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;cluster nodes are deployed.Storage policies support any shared datastores in your environment, such as VMFS, NFS, vSAN, and vSAN ESA.Depending on your vSphere storage environment and the needs of DevOps, you can create several storage policies for different classes of storage. When you enable a&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;and set up vSphere Namespaces, you can assign different storage policies to be used by various objects, components, and workloads.For example, if a&nbsp;vSphere Pod&nbsp;mounts three types of virtual disks and your vSphere storage environment has three classes of datastores, Bronze, Silver, and Gold, you can create storage policies for all datastores. You can then use the Bronze datastore for ephemeral and container image virtual disks, and use the Silver and Gold datastores for persistent volume virtual disks.<img alt=\"vspehere-pod-storage-9dad3179-6c73-4460-ab9d-5578df57a385.webp\" src=\"./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vspehere-pod-storage-9dad3179-6c73-4460-ab9d-5578df57a385.webp\" target=\"_self\">When you configure storage policies for datastores to be used with zones, follow these best practices: Make sure that a storage policy matchs either zonal datastores only or cross-zonal datastores only. Mixing both in a single policy leads to unpredictable behavior. Use a policy with zonal constraints to target zonal datastores. The system guarantees compatibility with zonal datastores and catches any misconfigurations during placement. If you create a policy without zonal constraints to use with zonal datastores, ensure it remains compatible with zonal datastores only. You must verify that no cross-zonal datastores match this policy. If you create a policy that matches cross-zonal datastores only, ensure it remains compatible with cross-zonal datastores at all times. Prevent any zonal datastore from matching this policy. SupervisorAt the&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;level, you configure a storage policy for&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;control plane VMs. In addition, if your deployment supports&nbsp;vSphere Pods, you assign storage polices and specify the datastore locations for ephemeral disks and container images. For information about setting storage when enabling&nbsp;Supervisor, see the&nbsp;Installing and Configuring vSphere Supervisor<br>&nbsp;documentation.

This ephemeral, or transient, storage lasts as long as the pod continues to exist. Ephemeral data persists across container restarts, but once the pod reaches the end of its life, the ephemeral virtual disk disappears.Each pod has one ephemeral virtual disk. As a vSphere administrator you use a storage policy to define the datastore location for all ephemeral virtual disks when configuring storage for the&nbsp;Supervisor.Container Image Virtual DisksContainers inside the&nbsp;vSphere Pod&nbsp;use images that contain the software to be run. The pod mounts images used by its containers as image virtual disks. When the pod completes its life cycle, the image virtual disks are detached from the pod.Image Service, an&nbsp;ESX&nbsp;component, is responsible for pulling container images from the image registry and transforming them into virtual disks to run inside the pod.<br><img alt=\"esx-can-cache-images-966c000f-edb1-4d4e-9c72-c5f571cc1647.original.png\" src=\"./https://vcf.wtf/assets/esx-can-cache-images-966c000f-edb1-4d4e-9c72-c5f571cc1647.original.png\" target=\"_self\">Persistent Storage for WorkloadsCertain Kubernetes workloads that DevOps run on a namespace require persistent storage to store data permanently.Persistent storage can be used by&nbsp;vSphere Pods,&nbsp;VKS&nbsp;clusters, VMs, and other workloads you run on the namespace. To make persistent storage available to the DevOps team, the vSphere administrator creates storage policies that describe different storage requirements and classes of services. The administrator then assigns storage policies and configures storage limits at a namespace level.To understand how&nbsp;vSphere Supervisor<br>&nbsp;works with persistent storage, be familiar with the such essential Kubernetes concepts as storage classes, persistent volumes, and persistent volume claims.

It is an extension of&nbsp;vCenter&nbsp;management that implements provisioning and lifecycle operations for persistent volumes.When provisioning persistent volumes, the component interacts with the vSphere First Class Disk functionality to create virtual disks that back the volumes. In addition, the CNS server component communicates with the Storage Policy Based Management to guarantee a required level of service to the disks.The CNS also performs query operations that allow vSphere administrators to manage and monitor persistent volumes and their backing storage objects through&nbsp;vCenter.First Class Disk (FCD)Also called Improved Virtual Disk. These disks reside on datastores and back ReadWriteOnce persistent volumes.When you use FCDs, keep in mind the following: FCDs do not support NFS 4.x protocols. Instead, use NFS 3. vCenter &nbsp;does not serialize operations on the same FCD. As a result, applications cannot simultaneously perform operations on the same FCD. Performing such operations as clone, relocate, delete, retrieve, and so on simultaneously from different threads causes unpredictable results. To avoid problems, applications must perform operations on the same FCD in a sequential order. FCD is not a managed object and does not support a global lock protecting multiple writes to a single FCD. As a result, FCD doesn't support multiple&nbsp; vCenter &nbsp;instances managing the same FCD. If you need to use multiple&nbsp; vCenter &nbsp;instances with FCDs, you have the following options: Multiple&nbsp; vCenter &nbsp;instances can manage different datastores. Multiple&nbsp; vCenter &nbsp;instances do not operate on the same FCD. Storage Policy Based ManagementStorage Policy Based Management is a&nbsp;vCenter&nbsp;service that supports provisioning of persistent volumes and their backing virtual disks according to storage requirements described in a storage policy. After provisioning, the service monitors compliance of the volume with the storage policy characteristics.

The CNS-CSI driver runs in the&nbsp;Supervisor&nbsp;and connects vSphere storage to Kubernetes environment on a namespace. The vSphere CNS-CSI communicates directly with the CNS component for all storage provisioning requests that originate from the namespace.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"Storage Policies for vSphere Zones","level":2,"id":"Storage_Policies_for_vSphere_Zones_0"},{"heading":"Storage Policies for a","level":2,"id":"Storage_Policies_for_a_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"How Supervisor Integrates with vSphere Storage","level":2,"id":"How_Supervisor_Integrates_with_vSphere_Storage_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Volkan Özçelik","coverImageURL":"./https://vcf.wtf/assets/vspehere-pod-storage-9dad3179-6c73-4460-ab9d-5578df57a385.webp","fullURL":"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/vsphere-supervisor-storage.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../../..","attachments":["assets/vspehere-pod-storage-9dad3179-6c73-4460-ab9d-5578df57a385.webp","assets/esx-can-cache-images-966c000f-edb1-4d4e-9c72-c5f571cc1647.original.html","assets/supervisor-cns-csi-8a7c342c-4c0b-4e84-9ab2-cf06dd7dc420.original.html"],"createdTime":1766409445885,"modifiedTime":1766409697274,"sourceSize":11843,"sourcePath":"VCF/Core Runtimes/vSphere/Platform Extensions/vSphere Supervisor/Supervisor Internals and Platform Integration/vSphere Supervisor Storage.md","exportPath":"vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-internals-and-platform-integration/vsphere-supervisor-storage.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":286,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/platform-extensions/vsphere-supervisor/vsphere-supervisor.html":{"title":"vSphere Supervisor","icon":"","description":"vSphere Supervisor&nbsp;is a control plane built in vSphere that integrates desired state and a single consistent API directly in the hypervisor.&nbsp;vSphere Supervisor&nbsp;enables native deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters, declarative virtual machines, and&nbsp;vSphere Pods&nbsp;alongside traditional workloads.

tenents of VCF, and thus, it requires clarification before anything else.In VCF-speak, the phrase “a workload is a workload” is not a tautology—it’s a deliberate abstraction boundary.It means that VCF intentionally collapses many very different execution models into a single management concept, and refuses to care about their internal form unless it must.Below is the precise meaning, layered from philosophy → architecture → consequences.From VCF’s point of view, a workload is simply “something that consumes resources and is governed by policy.”It is not:\na VM\na Container\n<br>a <a

policies apply?\nWhat lifecycle rules govern it?\nIf those questions can be answered, VCF is satisfied.VCF exists above:\n<br><a data-href=\"ESX\"

to runtime mechanics\nSo instead, VCF defines:\nWorkload = Policy + Placement + Lifecycle + Resources\nEverything else is delegated downward.All of the following are equally valid workloads in VCF:VCF deliberately does not rank or privilege any of these.In VCF, a workload is anything that consumes platform resources and is subject to platform policy—its internal shape is intentionally

remove this from the docs once I have a good enough template for the solution.\nMany tenants (Pepsi, Coca Cola, Sprite, Pizza Hut)\nEach tenant has an external Vault (or Vault instance) with paths that can overlap: credentials/db/finance is a common example Sync into an internal OpenBao (or internal Vault) via ESO\nInject into workloads via Vault Sidecar Injector\nYou want no path collisions and no possibility of cross-tenant access\nThere are two separate problems:\nStorage namespace collision in internal OpenBao\nRuntime authorization when workloads fetch secrets (injection)\nthis is the first half of the problem.Based on the official VCF Secret Service docs, a lot of the “last-mile consumption” is already solved (create secret → store it → inject it into pods/VMs as files), but tenancy isolation is explicitly coarse and largely stops at the Supervisor Namespace boundary. It’s there, but it’s not the fine-grained. That is any OpenBao secret bound to a namespace is visible to any workload in that namespace.That should be fine since tenants are effectively namespace-bound.The “Managing Secrets…” doc spells out delivery formats:\nvSphere Pods → file mount under /vault/secrets/&lt;user-provided-name&gt;\nVM Service VMs → disk-based transfer + read-only mount\nVKS (guest) cluster pods → file mount similar to vSphere Pods\nThis solves consistent delivery semantics per workload type.\nAll service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.\n^ that is the granularity we get. Which may or may not be fine based on the customers’ requirements.Also it’s worth noting that any notion of Organization/Project tenancy in the Secret Store model does not exist by architecture (which is also fine because secrets are namespace-bound, and tenants are also namespace-bound).None of the flows refer to Organization/Project at all. They are consistently “pick a Supervisor namespace; secrets live there”.That’s consistent with what we discussed earlier: governance constructs don’t appear at runtime.The docs show a pattern like secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; for retrieval.\nSecrets are stored in a “corresponding namespace” (meaning: per Supervisor namespace).\nVKS isolation is only at Supervisor namespace level (explicit).\nWithin a namespace, all service accounts can read all secrets (explicit).\nSo the tenancy story is not missing — it’s just coarse:\nTenant isolation = Supervisor Namespace isolation (and nothing finer is guaranteed).\nA safe mapping consistent with the doc’s retrieval convention would look like:\nExternal: credentials/db/finance\nInternal: secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/credentials/db/finance\n(or secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;some-secret-name&gt; that contains those K/Vs)\nThat avoids cross-tenant collisions because the Supervisor namespace becomes the first path segment.According to the docs, all tenants share the same unified internal secrets store (OpenBao).In the doc’s annotation model, you specify a secret “path” in the injector annotation. They show:\nvault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-...: \"secret/data/demo/db-cred\"\nInject Secrets in to a vSphere …\nSo for Pepsi, if you used the flattened name approach, you’d inject like:\nsecret/data/pepsi/auth__finance__db__creds\n…and because the auth role is tied to the namespace (example role demo), Pepsi workloads would authenticate with role pepsi and read from the pepsi/* prefix. ✅ In this doc model, within a tenant’s Supervisor namespace, any Pepsi workload can access any Pepsi secret.\n❌ Restricting secrets to only pods in a specific Kubernetes namespace inside the tenant is not supported here (especially for VKS guest clusters).\n✅ OpenBao paths look like secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; (KV v2 style).\n✅ In shared OpenBao, prevent collisions by ensuring the first path segment is the tenant namespace (pepsi, cocacola, …).\nVCF Secret Store Service does have guardrails that prevent a Coca-Cola workload from mounting Pepsi secrets, as long as you stay within the supported model.But those guardrails are namespace-scoped, not “tenant-aware in the abstract”, and they rely on how identities and roles are provisioned, not on OpenBao magically inferring tenancy.The guardrails are not:\n“OpenBao automatically understands tenants”\n“Vault paths are globally protected by magic”\nThey are:\nThe Vault/OpenBao token that a workload receives is issued in the context of a specific Supervisor Namespace.\nThat token is not shared across namespaces.\nSo:\nA Coca-Cola workload never gets the same token as a Pepsi workload\nTokens are not reusable across namespaces\nThis is enforced by Supervisor, not by Kubernetes RBAC alone.The injector examples in the docs consistently show:\na role name tied to the namespace (e.g. demo)\nsecrets read from secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/...\nThat implies (and matches how VMware typically wires these systems): Each Supervisor Namespace has a corresponding OpenBao role and policy.\nYou don’t see the policy YAML in the docs, but the model only works if: role pepsi → policy allows secret/data/pepsi/*\nrole cocacola → policy allows secret/data/cocacola/*\nOtherwise the examples would be unsafe.\nA pod can’t just arbitrarily say:\nvault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: secret/data/pepsi/db\nfrom another namespace, because:\nthe injector runs with Supervisor context\nthe auth role used is bound to the namespace\nthe token issued is constrained by that role\nSo even if a Coca-Cola pod requests a Pepsi path, the read fails.\nThat’s the critical point: request ≠ authorization.\nref:\n“All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.”\nThat sentence is not saying:\n“All namespaces can read all secrets.”\nIt’s saying:\n“Within one Supervisor Namespace, we don’t give you finer-grained scoping.”\nIf we ensure that:\nPepsi secrets are materialized under secret/data/pepsi/...\nCoca-Cola secrets under secret/data/cocacola/...\nThen VCF Secret Store Service guardrails already align with that:\nPepsi workloads authenticate as “Pepsi namespace”\nPepsi role can only read secret/data/pepsi/*\nCoca-Cola role cannot read Pepsi paths\nSo yes: If we respect the namespace-prefix contract, the rest of the consumption plumbing is already handled safely by VCF Secret Store Service.\nWe are not punching a hole in the security model by doing the sync.The model breaks only if you bypass the intended trust boundaries, for example:\nA single ESO instance with a token that can write/read all tenant prefixes\nManually creating secrets in the wrong namespace\nReusing roles or tokens across namespaces\nExposing OpenBao externally and letting workloads authenticate out-of-band\nThose are operator errors, not product gaps — but they’re exactly what auditors look for.VCF Secret Store Service enforces tenant isolation at the Supervisor Namespace boundary by issuing namespace-scoped identities and policies for secret access. As long as tenant secrets are materialized under their corresponding namespace paths, cross-tenant secret access is prevented by design. Fine-grained intra-namespace isolation is intentionally not provided.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mapping external Vault paths into internal OpenBao
