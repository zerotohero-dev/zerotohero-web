Each puzzle must harmonize to ensure a seamless, interactive, high-quality viewer experience.<p>The complexity increases even more when we decide to share not just our faces or voices but our desktops too. This is the path we have chosen in <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/VadidekiVolkan/schedule>our ongoing <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> series</a>: The live office hours we dedicate to the <strong>SPIFFE</strong> and <strong>SPIRE</strong> community.<p>This article provides a comprehensive guide for designing an intricate multi-platform streaming model. I want this to be a resource for my future self and the fantastic community interested in replicating such a setup. It’s an insider look into the dynamic and complex world of multi-streaming, showing how technology, when used innovatively, can foster powerful and engaging digital experiences.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Eli (left) and I (right) enjoying the show." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-11.33.11-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Eli (left) and I (right) enjoying the show.</div><h2 id=talkspiffe-is-that-something-new-can-i-eat-it>TalkSPIFFE? Is That Something New? Can I Eat It?</h2><p>Before I continue, it’s a perfect moment to delve deeper into what <a href=https://twitch.tv/VadidekiVolkan><strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong></a> truly is.<p><strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> is more than just a live stream; it’s a platform designed to demystify and elucidate the intricacies of the <a href=https://spiffe.io/><strong>SPIFFE</strong></a> (<em>Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone</em>) technology. It’s an opportunity for <strong>SPIFFE/SPIRE</strong> enthusiasts, professionals, and those who want to learn more about <strong>SPIFFE</strong> and <strong>SPIRE</strong> to come together and engage in enlightening discussions, learn from each other, and help foster a community.<p>We’ve aimed for <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> to be a space that feels both welcoming and informative rather than being strictly academic or intimidatingly technical. We believe in a more dynamic interaction that allows anyone and everyone to gain knowledge and contribute unique insights.<p>In our weekly sessions every other Friday, we tackle various <strong>SPIFFE</strong>-related topics, discuss the latest updates, share best practices, and do live demos.<p>Whether you’re just dipping your toes into the <strong>SPIFFE</strong> waters or are a seasoned professional looking to stay updated and share your wisdom, <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> offers you a place to do just that.<p>So join us in our upcoming streams, and let’s make <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> a thriving platform for learning, sharing, and collaborative growth in <strong>SPIFFE</strong> and * <em>SPIRE</em>*.<p>That was the segue 🙂 Now, back to our setup.<h2 id=a-deep-dive-into-the-talkspiffe-streaming-setup>A Deep Dive Into the TalkSPIFFE Streaming Setup</h2><p>Since my streaming setup is far from ordinary, I wanted to give you an inside look into the process.<p>In this article, I’ll share how we’ve used applications like <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/><strong>Audio Hijack</strong></a>, <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/><strong>Loopback</strong></a>, <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/><strong>Airfoil Satellite</strong></a>, <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/><strong>Farrago</strong></a>, <strong><em>Zoom</em></strong>, <strong><em>Discord</em></strong>, <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guest-star?language=en_US">Twitch’s Guest Star feature</a>, <a href=https://obsproject.com/><strong>Open Broadcaster Software (<em>OBS</em>)</strong>,</a> and <a href=https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay><strong>BetterDisplay</strong></a> to create a compelling and interactive live streaming experience.<p>Each platform plays a vital role, from integrating our desktops through Zoom and routing our audio via a Discord voice channel to broadcasting our video feed on Twitch. The added twist of background music takes the viewer experience to another level, immersing them in our conversational and instructional narrative.<h2 id=twitch-s-guest-star-feature-is-a-life-saver>Twitch’s Guest Star Feature is a Life Saver</h2><p>Navigating the turbulent waters of streaming a guest’s audio and video on a live stream can be challenging. This is where <a href=https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guest-star>Twitch’s innovative “<strong>Guest Star</strong>” feature</a> shines.<p>The <strong>Guest Star</strong> tool lets you establish “guest slot” browser sources you can deftly arrange in your broadcasting software. With ease, you can swiftly add or change the guests appearing in that slot directly through <strong>Twitch</strong>.<p>The beauty of this feature is its <strong>simplicity</strong>: Streamlining the process of integrating a guest’s video feed into your live stream, and all without needing to dabble with complex configurations or multiple third-party tools.<p>Using this feature, I can stream the camera of my guest directly as a browser source into my Open Broadcaster Software (<strong>OBS</strong>).<p>If I want, I can also change the guests appearing in that slot directly through Twitch, effortlessly integrating a guest’s video feed into my live stream without juggling complex configurations or multiple third-party tools.<p>So far, everything about <strong>Guest Star</strong> works like a charm.<h2 id=a-sneak-peek-at-the-backstage>A Sneak Peek at the Backstage</h2><p>Here’s how we typically initiate our stream:<p>Before the event starts, there is a 15-minute interval where the stream will be live and a “<em>starting soon</em>” scene with a countdown timer is displayed life (<em>the <code>63:46</code> countdown timer in the image below is just for demonstration purposes; consider it something like 11:25 or similar—starting from 15:00 and counting backward</em>).<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="The 'waiting room' and the countdown timer." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.30.25-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>The 'waiting room' and the countdown timer.</div><p>During that time, I invite <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/elinesterov/><strong>Eli</strong></a>, <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong>’s cohost, as a “<a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guest-star?language=en_US"><em>guest star</em></a>” to a virtual backstage. That’s how I can use his camera feed on the stream.<p>In addition, I initiate a Discord voice chat session from which we air Eli’s voice feed.<p>After I ensure the guests’ camera and sound work fine, using the <strong>Studio Mode</strong> of OBS, I make sure that all the scenes and camera feeds are up and running and there is no missing source anywhere.<p>This step is significant because when you reboot your system or restart OBS, sometimes OBS fails to detect some of the input sources, and you’ll need to update them manually.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="OBS's Studio mode.

Left: Upcoming scene; right: the scene streaming live.</div><p>I use <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/><strong>Audio Hijack</strong></a> for chaining, filtering, and mixing various audio streams. And I use <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/><strong>Loopback</strong></a> to create virtual audio interfaces that I can set as audio input sources for Zoom and Discord. As you’ll see shortly, the loopback interfaces I make in Audio Hijack will find their respective places as “<em>sinks</em>” in Audio Hijack.<h2 id=the-talkspiffe-audio-chain>The <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> Audio Chain</h2><p>Here follows our <strong>Audio Hijack</strong> stream setup. You can tap on the image to see an enlarged version. I will zoom in and explain each box in this layout below:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="The audio chain." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/audio-hijack.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>The audio chain.</div><p>It might look a bit involved, though fear not; we’ll dissect the entire audio chain piece by piece.<p>Let’s zoom into the topmost browser source first:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Splitting the background music." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.39.25-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Splitting the background music.</div><p>The input source named “<strong>MUSIC IN</strong>” is Safari playing a playlist of instrumental music as background music for <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong>. I split the audio into three parts:<ul><li>The top row is adjusted to a lower volume level and is to be used as the background music when we talk,<li>The middle row has a higher volume level, and it’s to be played before the stream starts or during breaks,<li>And the bottom one is a separate track that will be streamed to my and my guest Eli’s headphones.</ul><p>Then, there is an A/B switch (<em>see the image below</em>) where the top two rows meet:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="To the output device." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.39.55-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>To the output device.</div><p>Then, there is an A/B switch (<em>see the image above</em>) where the top two rows meet for me to toggle between two different volume levels and send the virtual output devices named “<strong>Stream Background Pass</strong>” and “<strong>Zoom Mic PassThru</strong>,” respectively.<p>These virtual devices are loopback audio interfaces that I created using <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/><strong>Loopback</strong></a>.<ul><li><strong>Stream Background Pass</strong> is used by OBS as a background music source for the stream,<li>and <strong>Zoom Mic PassThru</strong> is sent to the Zoom video chat session that we share this stream simultaneously.</ul><p>If you look closely, you’ll see that the top set of volume filters is lower than the bottom ones on the second row. This way, we can have quieter background music to talk over during the stream without becoming too loud to distract the audience. During breaks or before the stream begins, I can switch to the bottom lane to let the audience enjoy the music to its fullest.<p>Then comes the third row. Follow the arrows in the image below:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="We also enjoy the background music while streaming." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.40.25-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>We also enjoy the background music while streaming.</div><p>The third row is what Eli and I hear in our headphones as a piece of background music so that we can bob our heads to the same beats during the event 🙂.<p>Let’s move on to our next audio source: Discord. Discord is where I capture Eli’s voice and forward it into two mixers.<p>You’ll also see that “<strong><em>Guest Star</em></strong>” audio is forwarded to the same mixer. I aim to use the “Guest Star” feature as a backup audio source. So, if anything happens to Discord, I can disable Discord and swap it to Guest Star instead to capture Eli’s audio.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Splitting the guest audio." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.40.58-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Splitting the guest audio.</div><p>Or an alternative way is to use an A/B switch and keep both of the input sources enabled and switch between them using the A/B switch:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Using an A/B switch." src=/images/size/w1200/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-10.04.25-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Using an A/B switch.</div><p>Then, in the middle of the setup, I have two audio sources:<ul><li><strong>ELI AUDIO IN</strong> (<em>Discord</em>) is a Discord voice chat that Eli and I will use. I take Eli’s audio from that source to push it into <a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS (<em>Open Broadcast Software</em>)</a> as a stream source. While at that, I’ll also clone it and send it to my headphones through a separate channel.<li><strong>GUEST STAR</strong> (<em>Chrome</em>) is where Eli’s <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guest-star?language=en_US">Twitch Guest Star</a> browser source is. I keep it as a backup source in case Discord’s audio fails. Though I’ve had minor glitches while testing it as an audio source, I’m reluctant to use it. For now, it’s just a backup for emergencies.</ul><div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Mixing the vocals." src=/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.42.00-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Mixing the vocals.</div><p>The orange lines above pass through my microphone (<a href=https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b><strong><em>Shure SM7B</em></strong></a>), a general-purpose noise filter, a vocal-specialized noise filter, and an equalizer before it reaches an A/B switch, respectively.<p>I use the A/B switch to quickly prevent my voice from being sent to the stream. That way, I can tell something Eli behind the scenes without my voice broadcast live.<p>In the image below are my equalizer settings for the curious; this setup makes more voice subtly deeper. Overdo it, and you’ll sound like Darth Vader or an accented version of Morgan Freeman. Be very careful.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Equalizer settings." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.28.53-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Equalizer settings.</div><p>Since everyone’s audio gear, vocal cords, room, and vocal modulation needs differ, your equalizer setting will likely vary significantly from mine. So, I’m leaving this just as a reference point. Trust your ears and experiment with the settings until you are satisfied.<p>Remember: Subtler is better. Be so subtle that the difference is almost unnoticeable to an untrained ear. If you realize what you generate sounds considerably different than you, then you have overdone it. And, trust me, it’s <strong>very</strong> easy to overdo with one’s own vocals. When you set it up, take a 30-minute break, do something else, and then listen to your audio again. If it sounds odd, you have overshot some settings; try readjusting it.<p>And below is my noise gate. Again, this is a representative snapshot and may not meet your needs. Adjust the configuration yourself, and always use your ears.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Noise gate settings." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-1.29.12-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Noise gate settings.</div><p>The green line has the same setup except for the intermediate filtering.

In addition, using Twitch’s <strong>Guest Star</strong> feature as an audio source worked better for Eli than Discord’s audio. So, for now, we’ll use Discord only to share Eli’s Desktop, and for his camera and audio, we’ll use Twitch’s <strong>Guest Star</strong> feature.<p>Considering this, here’s our (<em>quote</em>) “simplified” audio pipeline:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Maybe not quite 'as' simple, but it looks good 🙂." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-12.34.34-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Maybe not quite 'as' simple, but it looks good 🙂.</div><h2 id=a-dedicated-streaming-machine>A Dedicated Streaming Machine</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Update 2021-05-27</strong><p>With <a href=https://zerotohero.dev/about/volkan-uses/>my new Mac Studio</a> I don’t need a dedicated streaming machine anymore. I can do everything on a single machine.<p>However, keeping a separate machine for streaming is still a good idea.</blockquote><p>To ensure a smooth streaming experience I use two machines:<ul><li>A Mac Mini that I use as a demo/screencast machine. I’ll call it the <strong>demo machine</strong>.<li>And a Macbook Pro that I use specifically for OBS and streaming and nothing else. I make sure that nothing unnecessary runs on it. I’ll call it the <strong>streaming machine</strong>.</ul><p>But why would I need a different machine to stream? Can’t it be done on the same box? Well, short answer: If you are using Apple devices, you’ll have to <strong><em>cut many corners</em></strong> to make streaming on a single machine work flawlessly. Using two machines provides better stream quality and will make my life much easier.<p>For a longer answer: One of the challenges we tackled in our <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong> setup is managing the computational load of running demos while live streaming. Since some of our demonstrations can be quite resource-intensive, performing them on the same machine as the live stream could potentially degrade the stream’s quality, leading to lower bitrates, missing frames, and a sub-optimal viewing experience.<p>To set this dual-machine configuration up, firstly, I connected the HDMI output of my demo machine to an <a href=https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4khttps://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k><strong>Elgato Camlink 4K</strong> capture card</a>, which is plugged into my streaming machine. I created a 1080p virtual display on my demo machine to share the required content using <a href=https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay><strong>BetterDisplay</strong></a>.<p>After connecting it to the streaming machine, too, <strong>Camlink 4K</strong> identifies itself as an additional display on my demo machine.<p>I mirrored the virtual monitor onto the Camlink 4K to have a separate view that I can enlarge on my larger 32“ monitor if I need to. In addition, the mirroring allows me to use a copy of the demo window right in front of me so that I won’t have to tilt my unnecessarily on the live stream.<p>The following set of images shows what the overall setup looks like.<p><img alt src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.57.58-PM.png><p><img alt src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.58.03-PM.png><p><img alt src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.58.21-PM.png><p><img alt src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.58.34-PM.png><p><img alt src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-2.59.56-PM.png><p>The feed from the <strong>Camlink 4K</strong> is then directed into <a href=https://obsproject.com/><strong>OBS</strong></a> on my streaming machine. You can check the “Physical Setup” section for additional details on how things connect at the physical layer.<p>Once things are set up this way, the demo machine shoulders the burden of resource-intensive demos. In contrast, my streaming machine remains dedicated to delivering a smooth streaming experience without system degradation.<h2 id=making-stream-management-easier>Making Stream Management Easier</h2><p>However, this dual-machine arrangement necessitates fast switching between the two systems during a live stream. To overcome this challenge, I adopted a few strategies:<h3 id=network-stability>Network Stability</h3><p><strong>All</strong> <strong>of my connections are wired</strong> to ensure stable network connectivity. I learned the hard way long ago never to rely on WiFi for such a critical setup.<h3 id=remote-connection-to-the-streaming-machine>Remote Connection to the Streaming Machine</h3><p>To streamline the control process, I remotely connect to my streaming machine from my demo machine. This way, I can use a single keyboard to interact with both machines.<h3 id=keyboard-and-mouse-that-can-connect-to-multiple-devices>Keyboard and Mouse that Can Connect to Multiple Devices</h3><p>There can be tricky moments when I need to move my mouse pointer into the virtual monitor – a task that’s impossible when you are remotely connected. To circumnavigate this, I use a <a href=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/mx/master-series.html><strong>Logi MX Master Wireless Mouse</strong></a>, which can be connected to up to three machines.<p><strong>Logi MX Master</strong>’s ability to instantly switch from one machine to another allows me to directly control the cursor on the streaming machine when required. As a fail-safe, I also keep an old (<em>but in perfect working condition</em>) wired mouse connected to my streaming machine (the MacBook Pro). I never fully trust remote connectivity!<p>I’ve crafted a resilient system that handles resource-heavy demonstrations while maintaining high-quality live streaming by implementing these strategies.<p>This is a testimony to the idea that you can overcome the challenges and constraints inherent in live streaming with careful planning and a bit of technological creativity.<h2 id=video-setup>Video Setup</h2><p>The video setup is comparably simpler than the “<em>auido</em>” one.<p>First of all, I only need to modify my camera’s properties. I need to change them only because I am using a green screen. Otherwise, I could very well use my camera feed as is.<p>I’ll also stream Eli’s camera feed as is without any modification.<p>Besides, I have a pretty good camera (<a href=https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/camcorders/consumer-camcorders/hc-v180k><strong><em>Panasonic HC-V180K</em></strong></a>) that makes my life much easier.<p>I just applied some alpha filter and color correction to my camera.<p>Here is the end result:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Me in front of the green screen, chroma key and color correction applied." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-8.18.44-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Me in front of the green screen, chroma key and color correction applied.</div><p>And here are the settings for the “<em>color correction</em>” and “<em>chroma-key</em>” filters, respectively:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Color correction settings." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-8.20.27-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Color correction settings.</div><div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Chroma key settings." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-8.20.53-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Chroma key settings.</div><h2 id=screen-annotations>Screen Annotations</h2><p>You remember the orange arrows in the “<em>Audio Device Chain</em>” section? I made them using <a href=https://presentify.compzets.com/><strong>Presentify</strong></a>.<p>The benefit of <strong>Presentify</strong> is it’s not only for annotating static images like this. You can use Presentify for online classes, video presentations, or tutorials by letting you annotate your screen and highlight your cursor, even when the application you are drawing over is in full-screen mode.<p>It’s a great helper, especially when you are demonstrating technical content. It’s one of those tools you don’t know how much you need before using.<h2 id=composing-scenes>Composing Scenes</h2><p>I already showed the camera setup for myself and my guest Eli.<p>I have two scenes in <strong>OBS</strong> that include those cameras in them. Having a separate scene for the camera instead of directly embedding the cameras in the scenes gives me the flexibility to modify them and reflect the changes in all the scenes I use.<p>For example, if I add a blue border around the camera view, it will be reflected everywhere the camera view is used; I won’t have to repeat adding that border around the camera to all of the scenes.<p>In addition, I can apply filters both to the camera and to the scene itself. This layered composition of color correction and chroma key filters gives more flexibility in configuring the sources.<p>Also, if I have a problem with a camera source like it is scaled incorrectly or not showing up, I can fix it in one scene instead of jumping into every scene that uses the camera and setting it one by one.<p>That part clarified, let’s begin with the camera scenes and go all the way up, building larger and larger scenes from sub-scenes.<h2 id=camera-scenes>Camera Scenes</h2><p>That’s the source of my camera schene called “<strong>my-camera</strong>.”<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="My camera." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-11.19.47-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>My camera.</div><p>And that’s the source of Eli’s camera view, which is a browser source from Twitch Guest Star.

This includes full-screen windows too. I can drag a Zoom desktop sharing session or a remote desktop connection to a different device or a browser window. Literally, I can easily show anything I can see on my streaming machine to the audience in 1080p resolution.

And since I have a white and low ceiling, it creates evenly-spread natural-looking lighting on me and on the curtain without creating solid shadows. When possible, bouncing light off of surfaces is always a better option than directly pointing it to the subjects (<em>the “subject” being me sitting on the chair in this case</em>).<li>There’s a warm fill light below, and <a href=https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/isjakt-led-floor-uplighter-reading-lamp-dimmable-nickel-plated-70459716/>you can get the fixture (<strong><em>ISJAKT led floor uplighter</em></strong>) from Ikea</a>.<li>There are two <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8FBZC2><strong>Neewer Key Lights</strong></a> in front of me. They are dirt cheap and are as effective as their expensive counterparts. But of course, you get what you pay for: there are no remote controls, you cannot change the color of the LEDs mid-stream, and you need to adjust its levels manually by pressing the buttons. But other than that, the lights’ quality, spread, and intensity are excellent. And nothing can compete with its price-over-performance ratio.<li>There’s a camera directly focused on me at an angle from above. It’s my faithful <a href=https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/camcorders/consumer-camcorders/hc-v180k><strong><em>Panasonic HC-V180K</em></strong></a>.<li>I have one sizeable curved monitor as my main stage and two 1080p monitors to display my guest’s screen and my demo machine’s desktop, respectively.<li>The large monitor is connected to my demo machine, and I established a remote desktop connection to the stream machine.<li>If needed, there is a button below the monitor that I can switch to view the desktop of the streaming machine without having to remotely connect to it as a backup measure.</ul><h2 id=video-and-audio-capture-layout>Video and Audio Capture Layout</h2><p>To put things into more perspective, here’s a schematic of the stream-related hardware that I use:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Streaming setup." src=/images/2023/06/hardware-setup.jpg><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Streaming setup.</div><p>The demo machine and the camera are connected to the streaming machine as video input sources through capture cards. I use <a href=https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034170131-Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-S-Technical-Specifications><strong>Elgato HD60S+</strong></a> and <a href=https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k><strong>Elgato Cam Link 4K</strong></a> for capture cards.<p>I like <strong>Cam Link 4K</strong> for its small form factor, but <strong>HD60S+</strong> offers a pass-through HDMI output, which can sometimes be helpful.<p><a href=https://store.focusrite.com/en-gb/product/scarlett-solo-3rd-gen/MOSC0024DM~MOSC0024DM><strong>Focusrite Scarlett Solo</strong></a> is my amplifier choice, and <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B"><strong>Shure SM7B</strong></a> is a microphone I cannot live without.<p>There’s also <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Microphones-CL-1-Cloudlifter-1-channel/dp/B004MQSV04><strong>CloudLifter</strong></a> as a signal booster. I use it to boost the gain of the audio signal, clean it, and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio.<p>But why do I need that gain boost? Because while <strong>Shure SM7B</strong> is known for its rich and detailed sound (<em>and hefty price tag</em>), it also has a relatively low output level compared to many other microphones. This means that it requires more gain from the preamp in the audio interface or mixer to produce a strong, clean signal.<h2 id=camera-and-lighting-setup>Camera and Lighting Setup</h2><p>I use a <a href=https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/camcorders/consumer-camcorders/hc-v180k><strong>Panasonic HC-V180K</strong></a> camcorder to stream myself. It’s known for its superior performance under good lighting and has never failed me once so far. The Panasonic HC-V180K feeds directly into the Elgato HD60S+ capture card, ensuring a crystal-clear, high-definition video feed.<p>Lighting is essential to any high-quality video setup, and ours is no exception. My <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8FBZC2><strong>Neewer Key Lights</strong></a>, positioned strategically behind the camera as you see below:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Camera and key lights." src=/images/2023/06/IMG-7337.jpg><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Camera and key lights.</div><p>But… but… but!

Instead of the camera, I see eye-to-eye with him, and I look around the vicinity of the camera. Since the camera is far away, and Perry sits within a few degrees of my line of sight, it’s as good as looking into the camera itself.<p>Just look at him; how can you say no to this little trouble maker 🙂:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt=Perry! src=/images/2023/06/IMG-7338.jpg><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Perry!</div><p>Aside from the key lights, I use a white oval light source to achieve a more natural and even light spread with reduced shadows.<p>This light bounces off the ceiling, subtly illuminating me and the green screen. It allows greater flexibility when adjusting the camera’s chroma key and color correction filters in OBS.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Bouncing light off of solid surfaces." src=/images/2023/06/IMG-7336.jpg><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Bouncing light off of solid surfaces.</div><p>And finally, to add depth and warmth to the video, I use a small fill light. Emitting a warm off-white yellow light, it delicately balances any shadows on my face and adds a touch of warmth to the overall video.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Fill light." src=/images/2023/06/IMG-7335.jpg><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Fill light.</div><p>Of course, this is only possible with the final piece of our video setup: the green screen.

In the quest for crisp and clear sound, I have taken measures to address potential acoustic challenges too. One of the essential steps in this direction is using <strong>acoustic canvas panels</strong>.<p>Strategically placed around the room, these panels are vital in managing the sound environment. Muffling the sounds bouncing off the walls significantly reduces any potential echo or reverb. This results in a clearer and more professional-sounding audio output for our stream.<p>Playing the right sound effects at the right moment during the stream is also a lot of fun. For that, I use <a href=https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/><strong>Farrago</strong></a>, which, to me, is the best rapid soundboard ever: Robust, easy to use, and integrates with almost everything, including your midi keyboard.<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt=Farrago. src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-11.23.47-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Farrago.</div><p>After all, no stream is fun without a bleating goat in it!<h2 id=bonus-game-streaming>Bonus: Game Streaming</h2><p>This one is not directly related to <strong>TalkSPIFFE</strong>, but I use it when I stream games. And Twitch is not much fun if you don’t stream video games every once in a while.<p>Since video games use many system resources, I follow a similar strategy and use my <strong>capture card</strong> to stream my demo computer’s desktop to <strong>OBS</strong> on my streaming computer.<p>And for the audio, I use <strong>Audio Hijack</strong> to redirect the game audio to the capture card and then from the capture card to one of the virtual audio devices that <strong>OBS</strong> is listening to.<p>The audio chain below links my game audio onto the capture card:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Game audio to capture card." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-8.07.21-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Game audio to capture card.</div><p>And this chain links the sound from the capture card to the loopback audio that OBS takes as an input source.<p>Sending audio through the capture card does not have to be game-related. You can get clever with it. For example, I’m thinking of using the Discord audio in my demo machine instead of the streamer machine and shoving its audio through the capture card:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="From discord to capture card." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-17-at-9.29.44-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>From discord to capture card.</div><p>Then, I can use it as an audio source, instead of the guest start audio that comes from Twitch, and disable the “<em>guest star</em>” Chrome audio input entirely as shown below:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="From capture card to guest in." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-17-at-9.32.26-AM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>From capture card to guest in.</div><p>That would mean running one less application on the stream machine, which would ensure an even smoother streaming experience.<p>Finally, here is how the game looks on OBS, the game audio streaming from the Vocals track is seen below:<div class=z2h-image><p class=img><img alt="Game streamed in OBS with audio coming from the virtual device." src=/images/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-8.08.04-PM.png><p class=alt style=text-align:center;margin-top:-1.125em;font-size:1em;font-style:italic>Game streamed in OBS with audio coming from the virtual device.</div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Remember that every stream is different, and every streamer’s’ setup, needs, and wants will differ too. Though I hope that this article can help some of you folks inspire and that you can use it as a starting point in your streaming journey.<p>And things change. There is no perfect setup; you keep on adjusting. For example, after our first pilot we realized that streaming to Zoom caused some audio echo/feedback issues on the “guest” end of things, and we decided it’s not worth it at the moment for two reasons:<ol><li>First, since we don’t have a very large audience (yet), it’s not worth splitting it to multiple venues. We can use Twitch as the one single place to stream things, and we can use SPIFFE slack workspace for questions. That would unite the community and will result in people exchanging comments and ideas in the same medium instead of spreading the creative juice to several mediums.<li>Second, it makes things simpler to manage, and with less moving parts there’s less possibility to make errors too.</ol><p>That said, the world of live-streaming is an ever-evolving landscape, one that’s limited only by the boundaries of your imagination. Whether you’re a seasoned streamer or just dipping your toes into these waters, remember that every stream is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create unforgettable experiences for your viewers.<p>Keep pushing the boundaries, and may the source be with you 🦄.<hr><h2 id=section-contents>Section Contents</h2><ul><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/base64-decoding-a-string-in-go/>Base64 Decoding a String in Go</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/destructure/>Use Destructuring to Remove Attributes</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/getting-the-body-of-an-http-request-with-go/>Getting the Body of an HTTP Request With Go</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/lets-create-a-syslog-logger/>Let’s Create a Syslog Logger</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/make-your-code-leaner/>Make Your Code Leaner By Extracting Method</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/mastodon-101/>Who Else Wants to Have Their Own Mastodon Server?</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/microservice-env-vars/>How to Ensure Environment Variables Are Set</a></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/scaling-your-node-api-like-a-boss/>Scaling Your Node.js API Like a Boss</a></p><li><p><strong>▶ The Live Stream Dream</strong></p><li><p><a href=https://zerotohero.dev/tips/zshell-startup-files/>.zprofile, .zshrc, .zenv, OMG!
