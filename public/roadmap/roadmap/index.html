whenever I get a similar question that has not entirely been addressed by what I have here.</blockquote><p>I tried to keep the suggestions here as much field-agnostic as I can to make it beneficial to you no matter what part of “<em>the stack</em>” you are interested in.<blockquote><p><strong>What Stack?!</strong><p>I also honestly believe that there is no such thing called “the stack”, and the boundaries between the layers of “the stack” have vanished long time ago, so it is a “<strong>mesh</strong>”—<em>if anything</em>—rather than a stack, but that’s the topic of another article 🙂.</blockquote><h2 id=how-to-read-this-article>How To Read This Article</h2><p>Do not just scan this article as if you are scanning through your birdsite news feed. I am not going to be humble here: This article it is the accumulation of years and years of experience. So, give it the <strong>time</strong> and <strong>concentration</strong> it deserves.<p>While you are reading, you’ll find <a href=https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-read-a-paper.html>links to other useful materials, such as this one</a>. <strong>Do not skip them</strong>: They are as important as the article itself.<p>With that said, let us begin, shall we?<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>People continuously ask me variations of the following questions at least a couple of times a week:<p>“<em>I am a self-educated-developer/programming-enthusiast/you-name-it.<br> I can write code; however, when I dive into complex codebases, I get lost.</em>”<p>Or, something like that:<p>“<em>People assume that I know JavaScript, and I confess: I am a JavaScript developer who doesn’t know how to develop.</em>”<p>I even got this one 😄:<p>“<em>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi; you’re my only hope.</em>”<p>Since answering the same question over and over again is not the best use of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost>opportunity cost of my time</a>, I wanted to answer them here, once and for all.<h2 id=is-it-the-impostor-s-syndrome>Is It the “Impostor’s Syndrome”?</h2><p>Although there’s a hint of <a href=https://www.fastcompany.com/40421352/the-five-types-of-impostor-syndrome-and-how-to-beat-them>impostor’s syndrome</a> in those questions, there also exists a <strong>deep concern</strong> that waits to be addressed.<p>All of these questions translate to the following:<ul><li>“<em>How do I leap to the next level in my field of expertise?</em>”<li>“<em>How do I become the next possible version of myself?</em>”</ul><p>These questions require a much well-thought-out answer than a “<em>It’s easy; you see: Learn React and MongoDB, and you are good to go.</em>” answer.<p>So here it goes.<h2 id=ask-questions-doubt-everything-trust-in-evidence>Ask Questions, Doubt Everything, Trust in Evidence</h2><p>If you forget everything else you read here, take this “<em>red pill</em>”, and you’ll be fine:<blockquote><p><strong>Ask</strong> Questions. <strong>Doubt</strong> everything. <strong>Trust</strong> in evidence.</blockquote><p>☝️ That is the <strong>ultimate</strong> way to become a great developer: The rest is just trivia.<p>Let me give you a related formula:<ul><li>Ask questions.<li>Take initiative.<li>Move out of your comfort zone.</ul><p>Here is how it goes:<h3 id=ask-questions>Ask Questions</h3><p>As long as there are people around and you know that there are things that you don’t know: Ask them out.<blockquote><p>There are naïve questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. However, every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.<p><strong>Carl Sagan</strong>—<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</a></blockquote><ul><li>Ask dumb questions.<li>Ask scary questions.<li>The more you ask, the better.</ul><p>While you are at it, <a href=http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>learn how to ask smart questions</a> and digest the fact that <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World>there are no dumb questions</a>.<h3 id=take-initiative>Take Initiative</h3><p>After asking as many questions as you <strong>possibly</strong> can, it is time to take the reins into your hand because after asking enough questions, you’ll eventually run into a set of problems that your coworkers, your friends, and your colleagues don’t know how to solve either.<p>Trust me; this is <strong>very</strong> easy 😉.<p>What you’ll do next is even easier:<ul><li><strong>Decide</strong> that you will figure out and solve this unsolvable problem anyway.<li>Then solve it.</ul><p>Voila!<p>You have solved a domain-specific problem that nobody else has an answer to.<h3 id=move-out-of-your-comfort-zone>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</h3><p>The more you program, the more issues you’ll find that…<ul><li>You don’t know.<li>Your colleagues don’t know.<li>Google doesn’t know.<li>And you’ll <strong>have to</strong> figure out (<em>as if your job depends on it—’cuz it does 😉</em>).</ul><p>Try to challenge yourself to <a href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/this-what-happens-when-you-move-out-your-comfort-zone.html><strong>move out of your comfort zone</strong></a>.<p>Screw everything.

Though, these two books will cover all your algorithm bases.<h2 id=learn-to-learn>Learn to Learn</h2><p>Before even beginning your learning adventure, you need to know two things:<ul><li>You should <strong>know</strong> how you learn: What type of learner you are.<li>You need to “<strong>learn to learn</strong>”.</ul><p>That might sound “<em>too meta</em>”, so let me elaborate:<p><strong>Learning to learn</strong> is easier said than done because to “<em>learn to learn</em>”, you have to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself><strong>know yourself</strong></a> first—you have to have an idea of what type of a learner you are: There is no “<em>one size fits all</em>” solution in learning.<blockquote><p>“Every fighter has a different way of eating yogurt.”<p>— Turkish proverb</blockquote><p>Are you an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning><strong>inductive learner</strong></a> who starts with the foundation and understands the bigger picture by connecting pieces together.<p>Alternatively, are you a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning><strong>deductive learner</strong></a> who likes to see a working system as a whole, only to split it into is building blocks recursively, and understand each piece until there is nothing left to split apart.<p>Are you a <a href=https://www.thestudygurus.com/visual-study-tips/><strong>visual learner</strong></a>? Do you use flashcards? Do you want to draw things on a whiteboard? Do you want to look at things “<em>from a different perspective</em>” to “<em>get the hang of it</em>.” Do you understand things best when you have a “<em>clear picture</em>” in your mind?<h2 id=learn-how-you-learn>Learn How You Learn</h2><p>Do you like watching videos to learn things, or are you more comfortable when you read books and articles and then apply the concepts you read at your own pace?<p>Do you learn by playing toy projects?<p>Do you learn by reading others’ code?<p>There’s no exact answer to the “<em>how do I learn?</em>” question.<p>If you’re not sure, I’d suggest you try a variety of different approaches and see which ones fit the best for you.<blockquote><p><strong>Caveat</strong><br> An unrelated cautionary note: Most people don’t fit perfectly into a single learning-style category, so it’s highly likely that you will be better off using <strong>a mixture of learning styles</strong> and techniques.</blockquote><p>Watch yourself, and be more aware of what styles of learning you prefer the most.<h2 id=don-t-rush>Don’t Rush</h2><p>Learning to code is no different from learning any other skill: It’s a <strong>slow</strong>, <strong>painstaking</strong>, and <strong>gradual</strong> process. The more you practice, the better you’ll get.<p>Take “<em>reading others’ code</em>” for example. Do you have a problem reading others’ code? Then attack the problem right at its heart:<ul><li><strong>Pick</strong> a few open source projects from <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a>.<li><strong>Read</strong> the code in there until your eyes bleed.<li>Then <strong>read some more</strong>.</ul><p>It is a slow and gradual process: <strong>Be patient</strong>.<h2 id=before-you-begin-programming>Before You Begin Programming…</h2><p>No matter what you want to learn, if you aspire to be a good developer, you will need the following skills. So I encourage you to learn them sooner than later.<p>After you are comfortable with them, you can continue your programming journey from where you left off.<p>Here is a short list of skills that you’ll likely need for starters:<ul><li>A basic-level of <strong>terminal</strong> knowledge.<li>Ability to write simple <strong>shell scripts</strong>.<li>Basic knowledge of <strong>git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>.<li>And knowledge about how to <strong>ssh</strong> into a server.</ul><h2 id=where-to-go-from-here>Where to Go From Here</h2><p><a href=/tags/roadmap>There are a handful of articles that I keep on writing to augment this roadmap</a>.<p>Here, you can find the list below, for your convenience.
