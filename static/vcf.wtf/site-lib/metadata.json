enables network connectivity, operations, and scale. It uses a software-defined approach to networking that spans data centers, clouds and application frameworks.NSX brings networking services closer to the application, whether running on virtual machines (VMs), containers or physical servers. This allows for a cloud operating model where networks can be provisioned and managed independently of the underlying hardware.NSX abstracts network services from the underlying hardware, enabling programmable infrastructure through APIs. You can implement policies and workflows to automate tasks like network provisioning, security enforcement, load balancing, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency.NSX provides a complete set of logical networking capabilities and services, including logical switching, routing, distributed load balancing, virtual private network (VPN), quality of service (QoS), and monitoring.Enable logical Layer 2 overlay extensions across a routed (Layer 3) fabric within and across data center boundaries.Dynamic routing between virtual networks that is performed in a distributed manner in the hypervisor kernel, and scale-out routing with active-active failover with physical routers. Static routing and dynamic routing protocols are supported, including support for IPv6.Complete data plane isolation among tenants with a separate routing table, network address translation (NAT), and edge firewall support in each VRF on the&nbsp; Support for bridging between VLANs configured on the physical network and&nbsp;NSX overlay networks, for seamless connectivity between virtual and physical workloads.Site-to-site and unmanaged VPN for cloud gateway services.By using&nbsp;NSX, you can move workloads between racks and data centers by decoupling them from the underlying networks.Centralized policy configuration and enforcement across multiple locations from a single pane of glass, enabling network-wide consistent policy, operational simplicity, and simplified disaster recovery architecture. Enable consistent networking and security across data center sites, and across private cloud boundaries, irrespective of underlying physical topology or cloud platform.NSX can manage the provisioning, deployment, operations and retirement of networking infrastructure and applications from a central control pane.

It’s there, but it’s not the fine-grained. That is any OpenBao secret bound to a namespace is visible to any workload in that namespace.That should be fine since tenants are effectively namespace-bound.The “Managing Secrets…” doc spells out delivery formats:\nvSphere Pods → file mount under /vault/secrets/&lt;user-provided-name&gt;\nVM Service VMs → disk-based transfer + read-only mount\nVKS (guest) cluster pods → file mount similar to vSphere Pods\nThis solves consistent delivery semantics per workload type.\nAll service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.\n^ that is the granularity we get. Which may or may not be fine based on the customers’ requirements.Also it’s worth noting that any notion of Organization/Project tenancy in the Secret Store model does not exist by architecture (which is also fine because secrets are namespace-bound, and tenants are also namespace-bound).None of the flows refer to Organization/Project at all. They are consistently “pick a Supervisor namespace; secrets live there”.That’s consistent with what we discussed earlier: governance constructs don’t appear at runtime.The docs show a pattern like secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; for retrieval.\nSecrets are stored in a “corresponding namespace” (meaning: per Supervisor namespace).\nVKS isolation is only at Supervisor namespace level (explicit).\nWithin a namespace, all service accounts can read all secrets (explicit).\nSo the tenancy story is not missing — it’s just coarse:\nTenant isolation = Supervisor Namespace isolation (and nothing finer is guaranteed).\nA safe mapping consistent with the doc’s retrieval convention would look like:\nExternal: credentials/db/finance\nInternal: secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/credentials/db/finance\n(or secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;some-secret-name&gt; that contains those K/Vs)\nThat avoids cross-tenant collisions because the Supervisor namespace becomes the first path segment.According to the docs, all tenants share the same unified internal secrets store (OpenBao).In the doc’s annotation model, you specify a secret “path” in the injector annotation. They show:\nvault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-...: \"secret/data/demo/db-cred\"\nInject Secrets in to a vSphere …\nSo for Pepsi, if you used the flattened name approach, you’d inject like:\nsecret/data/pepsi/auth__finance__db__creds\n…and because the auth role is tied to the namespace (example role demo), Pepsi workloads would authenticate with role pepsi and read from the pepsi/* prefix. ✅ In this doc model, within a tenant’s Supervisor namespace, any Pepsi workload can access any Pepsi secret.\n❌ Restricting secrets to only pods in a specific Kubernetes namespace inside the tenant is not supported here (especially for VKS guest clusters).\n✅ OpenBao paths look like secret/data/&lt;supervisor-namespace&gt;/&lt;secretName&gt; (KV v2 style).\n✅ In shared OpenBao, prevent collisions by ensuring the first path segment is the tenant namespace (pepsi, cocacola, …).\nVCF Secret Store Service does have guardrails that prevent a Coca-Cola workload from mounting Pepsi secrets, as long as you stay within the supported model.But those guardrails are namespace-scoped, not “tenant-aware in the abstract”, and they rely on how identities and roles are provisioned, not on OpenBao magically inferring tenancy.The guardrails are not:\n“OpenBao automatically understands tenants”\n“Vault paths are globally protected by magic”\nThey are:\nThe Vault/OpenBao token that a workload receives is issued in the context of a specific Supervisor Namespace.\nThat token is not shared across namespaces.\nSo:\nA Coca-Cola workload never gets the same token as a Pepsi workload\nTokens are not reusable across namespaces\nThis is enforced by Supervisor, not by Kubernetes RBAC alone.The injector examples in the docs consistently show:\na role name tied to the namespace (e.g. demo)\nsecrets read from secret/data/&lt;namespace&gt;/...\nThat implies (and matches how VMware typically wires these systems): Each Supervisor Namespace has a corresponding OpenBao role and policy.\nYou don’t see the policy YAML in the docs, but the model only works if: role pepsi → policy allows secret/data/pepsi/*\nrole cocacola → policy allows secret/data/cocacola/*\nOtherwise the examples would be unsafe.\nA pod can’t just arbitrarily say:\nvault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: secret/data/pepsi/db\nfrom another namespace, because:\nthe injector runs with Supervisor context\nthe auth role used is bound to the namespace\nthe token issued is constrained by that role\nSo even if a Coca-Cola pod requests a Pepsi path, the read fails.\nThat’s the critical point: request ≠ authorization.\nref:\n“All service accounts have read access to all secrets of that namespace.”\nThat sentence is not saying:\n“All namespaces can read all secrets.”\nIt’s saying:\n“Within one Supervisor Namespace, we don’t give you finer-grained scoping.”\nIf we ensure that:\nPepsi secrets are materialized under secret/data/pepsi/...\nCoca-Cola secrets under secret/data/cocacola/...\nThen VCF Secret Store Service guardrails already align with that:\nPepsi workloads authenticate as “Pepsi namespace”\nPepsi role can only read secret/data/pepsi/*\nCoca-Cola role cannot read Pepsi paths\nSo yes: If we respect the namespace-prefix contract, the rest of the consumption plumbing is already handled safely by VCF Secret Store Service.\nWe are not punching a hole in the security model by doing the sync.The model breaks only if you bypass the intended trust boundaries, for example:\nA single ESO instance with a token that can write/read all tenant prefixes\nManually creating secrets in the wrong namespace\nReusing roles or tokens across namespaces\nExposing OpenBao externally and letting workloads authenticate out-of-band\nThose are operator errors, not product gaps — but they’re exactly what auditors look for.VCF Secret Store Service enforces tenant isolation at the Supervisor Namespace boundary by issuing namespace-scoped identities and policies for secret access. As long as tenant secrets are materialized under their corresponding namespace paths, cross-tenant secret access is prevented by design. Fine-grained intra-namespace isolation is intentionally not provided.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mapping external Vault paths into internal OpenBao without conflicts","level":2,"id":"Mapping_external_Vault_paths_into_internal_OpenBao_without_conflicts_0"},{"heading":"Injecting secrets without cross-tenant association","level":2,"id":"Injecting_secrets_without_cross-tenant_association_0"},{"heading":"Delivery Format","level":3,"id":"Delivery_Format_0"},{"heading":"Secret Mapping","level":3,"id":"Secret_Mapping_0"},{"heading":"There is a Single OpenBao Instance","level":2,"id":"There_is_a_Single_OpenBao_Instance_0"},{"heading":"How Does Injection Refer to This","level":3,"id":"How_Does_Injection_Refer_to_This_0"},{"heading":"Takeaways","level":2,"id":"Takeaways_0"},{"heading":"Cross-Tenant Access to Secrets","level":3,"id":"Cross-Tenant_Access_to_Secrets_0"},{"heading":"Guardrail #1 — Namespace-scoped identity issuance","level":4,"id":"Guardrail_#1_—_Namespace-scoped_identity_issuance_0"},{"heading":"Guardrail #2 — Namespace-scoped auth roles","level":4,"id":"Guardrail_#2_—_Namespace-scoped_auth_roles_0"},{"heading":"Guardrail #3 — Admission + injector coupling","level":4,"id":"Guardrail_#3_—_Admission_+_injector_coupling_0"},{"heading":"Adding Federation In","level":2,"id":"Adding_Federation_In_0"},{"heading":"When Can This Model Break","level":2,"id":"When_Can_This_Model_Break_0"},{"heading":"One Line for the Design Doc","level":2,"id":"One_Line_for_the_Design_Doc_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:todo"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"secrets-federation-notes.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766334387128,"modifiedTime":1766336103774,"sourceSize":8089,"sourcePath":"Secrets Federation Notes.md","exportPath":"secrets-federation-notes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":89,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"supervisor-and-supervisor-cluster.html":{"title":"Supervisor and Supervisor Cluster","icon":"","description":"\nA mode / capability of a vSphere cluster\nMeans: “This vSphere cluster has Kubernetes enabled and is running the Supervisor control plane” or less wordy: “*a vSphere cluster with Supervisor enabled”.
