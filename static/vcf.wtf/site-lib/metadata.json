They operate at different abstraction layers and serve different purposes in the lifecycle of infrastructure and workloads.\nA template defines what a single resource looks like\nA blueprint defines how multiple resources come together.\nA template is a reusable, preconfigured artifact that represents one resource, typically:\nVM Template A golden VM image (OS + patches + base software)\nUsed to rapidly deploy identical VMs OVF/OVA Templates Portable packaged virtual appliances Content Library Templates <br>Shared across <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"vCenter Server\"

target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Domain</a>s Infrastructure-level\nStatic\nLow abstraction\nNo logic, no dependencies\nConsumed by automation tools (not orchestrating anything themselves)\nA Template says:\n“This is what a machine looks like when it’s born.”\nIn contrast, a single Blueprint can define these following components:\n2 application VMs\n1 database VM\nA load balancer\nA network segment\nPlacement rules\nLifecycle actions\nThat entire topology is deployed as one logical unit.\nBlueprints consume templates.\nHere is possible flow:\nTemplate: Ubuntu 22.04 VM with hardened baseline Blueprint: Uses that template\nDefines how many instances\nAttaches networks\nApplies policies\nAdds lifecycle logic\nSo: Templates = building blocks\nBlueprints = architectural plans\nIn Kubernetes terms (for intuition):\nTemplate ≈ Container Image\nBlueprint ≈ Helm Chart / Application Manifest\nUnderstanding this distinction prevents common mistakes:\n❌ Treating templates as reusable environments\n❌ Expecting templates to handle lifecycle logic\n❌ Trying to encode business logic inside VM images\nCorrect mental model:\nTemplates are static\nBlueprints are dynamic and declarative\nAs a quick comparison:\nTemplate\n→ A reusable VM or image\n→ Low-level, static, infrastructure-focused\nBlueprint\n→ A declarative application/environment definition\n→ High-level,

organization typically maps to a business unit or tenant.Organizations exist only in VCF Automation, not in Kubernetes.It is the outermost “contract boundary” for consumption, not execution.An Organization is a logical tenant boundary that groups identity, policy, quotas, visibility, and approval flows for consuming infrastructure and platform services.It answers:\nWho is consuming?\nWhat

Identity Broker (vIDB) is the identity-federation service used by VCF Single Sign-On (SSO) to provide a unified authentication configuration across multiple components in a VCF environment.vIDB centralizes authentication across the major VCF infrastructure components so that administrators and users can sign in once and seamlessly access those systems using a corporate identity provider

then VCF components are configured to trust/use that SSO configuration.<br>At a high level, VCF Identity Broker is an identity federation/intermediary service that sits between your enterprise

Directory via LDAP, OpenLDAP. Centralized authentication and SSO—better user experience and reduced login friction.\nIntegrates with corporate IdPs—enables MFA, policy enforcement, and audit logging from your enterprise identity layer.\nScalable deployment options—embedded for simplicity, appliance for scale/resilience. Adds an additional component to deploy and manage (especially in appliance mode).\nRequires careful role mapping and RBAC planning so that IdP groups/roles map correctly to VCF permissions.\nLegacy components may not participate in SSO the same way — they might still require local accounts even after VCF Identity Broker is configured.\nA very real operational problem in multi-tenant systems is: Users get recreated/reidentified when you switch identity providers (or change claims, subject formats, etc.).\nIf a tenant starts on IdP-A and later moves to IdP-B, you want a controlled way to preserve user access and authorization mappings.\nRemapping is the “bridge” that avoids breaking RBAC simply because the upstream identity changed.\nRemapping is usually about reconciling user identities inside the platform’s internal user store / directory representation when the upstream IdP changes. It’s not “magic federation”—it’s an administrative identity-correlation operation.\nUpstream IdP (Okta/Entra/ADFS/LDAP-backed federation)\nAuthenticates the human. Issues identity assertions / tokens.\nvIDB (VCF Identity Broker)\nProvides VCF SSO: consistent auth configuration across VCF components.\nVCF Automation OIDC Services / IdP Proxy\nProvides

rapid detection, diagnosis, and resolution of performance issues.Rather than relying solely on static thresholds or isolated metrics, performance monitoring leverages continuous telemetry and analytics to understand how workloads behave over time, identify anomalies, and surface emerging risks before they impact users or SLAs.In practical terms, it answers:\nAre my applications getting the resources they expect, and if not—why?\nPerformance monitoring collects and analyzes application-level metrics from virtual machines and supporting infrastructure.\nCPU, memory, disk, and network

shifts the perspective from “is the host healthy?” to “is the application experiencing friction?”Advanced analytics and machine learning are applied to identify patterns and anomalies that traditional monitoring often misses.\nDetects abnormal behavior relative to learned baselines\nCorrelates symptoms across compute, storage, and networking layers\nHighlights probable root causes rather than isolated alerts\nEnables faster time to resolution while avoiding unnecessary overprovisioning\nThe result is signal over noise, especially in large or dynamic environments.Performance monitoring ensures workloads maintain reliable access to required resources.\nIdentifies resource contention and saturation risks\nSurfaces inefficient resource usage and imbalance\nSupports proactive scaling

It combines the power of VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) with VCF’s operational tooling to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations.Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.<br>HCX stands for Hybrid Cloud eXtension—it’s not just another name for <a data-href=\"vMotion\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/workload-mobility-and-resilience/vmotion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">vMotion</a>. It’s a comprehensive application mobility platform from VMware that enables workload migration, workload rebalancing, and business continuity across data centers and clouds.VCF Operations HCX has the following capabilities:\nSeamless workload migration. Migrate VMs and applications in waves live or in bulk with minimal or zero downtime.\nNetwork extension. Extend networks while preserving IP addresses and topologies to maintain application connectivity.\nInter-and intra-VCF mobility. Enable workload mobility within and across multiple&nbsp;VCF instances, including site-to-site and region-to-region migrations.\nApplication placement optimization. Enables high-performance application mobility across different environments, making it easier to optimize workload placement based on business requirements.\nAt its heart, VCF Operations HCX is an application mobility platform that:\n**Connects environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—with optimized, secure network interconnectivity.\nEnables workload migration—live or bulk migration of virtual machines (VMs) and applications between environments with minimal downtime.\nSupports hybrid cloud adoption—making it easier to modernize, consolidate, or balance workloads across sites.\nEssentially, it extends the capabilities of VCF so that moving workloads into, out of, or around your VCF estate is seamless and automated.VCF Operations HCX automates the process of moving VMs and applications from one environment to another. This includes:\nLive migrations (zero or near-zero downtime)\nBulk migrations for large-scale moves\nCross-platform migrations (including non-vSphere sources in some scenarios)\nNetwork extension so IPs/MACs remain consistent during migration\nThis makes migrations faster, less error-prone, and less disruptive than traditional approaches.HCX builds a secure, encrypted interconnect between sites that:\nExtends Layer-2 networks across sites\nPreserves VM networking so that workloads keep their addresses\nProvides optimized tunnels tailored for high-speed bulk movement\nCloud adoption isn’t a one-time event — usage patterns change. HCX enables:\nMoving workloads based on performance needs\nRebalancing for cost or compliance reasons\nContinuous optimization of where workloads run\nThis is key in hybrid environments where business needs or performance requirements evolve over time.VCF Operations HCX has deeper integration with VCF:\nUnified management &amp; single sign-on with other VCF components\nShared licensing managed through VCF Operations\nIntegrated planning &amp; execution workflows with VCF Operations for Networks\nEasier deployment with a single unified HCX Manager appliance\nThat means less separate manual setup and a smoother experience from discovery to execution.Imagine you’re relocating a city’s services (libraries, police stations, hospitals) to a new smart city:\nTraditional migration = manually moving each building piece by piece.\nVCF Operations HCX = building a dedicated transit corridor where services can shift live without interruption, while preserving all their connections and addresses — all orchestrated by a central operations dashboard instead of manual labor.\n<br>vMotion is VMware’s native live-migration technology for moving a running VM between <a data-href=\"ESX\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/core-runtimes/vsphere/core-components/esx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ESX</a> hosts (including memory and CPU state), usually within the same <a data-href=\"VCF Domain\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/concepts/design-and-abstractions/architectural-constructs/vcf-topology/vcf-domain/vcf-domain.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Domain</a> or cluster.HCX doesn’t replace vMotion; it leverages it as one migration method (called “HCX vMotion”) when moving workloads between HCX-connected sites. It also supports:\nCold Migration: Powered-off VMs\nBulk Migration: Parallel, batched workloads\nReplication-Assisted vMotion: Parallel live migrations via replication + vMotion\nSo, vMotion is a component inside HCX’s larger orchestration and connectivity framework. VCF Operations HCX is VMware’s integrated workload mobility solution within VMware Cloud Foundation.\nIt simplifies application migration and workload rebalancing across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.\nVia optimized network extension and interconnects, it preserves application connectivity and minimizes disruption.\nRecent integrations with VCF improve deployment, management, and operational workflows.\n<br><a data-href=\"VCF Day 0 Tasks\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/day-n-operations/vcf-day-0-tasks.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Day 0 Tasks</a>, <a data-href=\"VCF Day 1 Tasks\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/day-n-operations/vcf-day-1-tasks.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Day 1 Tasks</a>, or <a data-href=\"VCF Day 2 Tasks\" href=\"./https://vcf.wtf/vcf/control-planes/vcf-operations/day-n-operations/vcf-day-2-tasks.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VCF Day 2 Tasks</a> could be nice places to visit from here.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Core Concept","level":2,"id":"Core_Concept_0"},{"heading":"What Does “VCF Operations HCX” Do","level":2,"id":"What_Does_“VCF_Operations_HCX”_Do_0"},{"heading":"1.

tenents of VCF, and thus, it requires clarification before anything else.In VCF-speak, the phrase “a workload is a workload” is not a tautology—it’s a deliberate abstraction boundary.It means that VCF intentionally collapses many very different execution models into a single management concept, and refuses to care about their internal form unless it must.Below is the precise meaning, layered from philosophy, to architecture, to consequences.From VCF’s point of view, a workload is simply “something that consumes resources and is governed by policy.”It is not:\n<br>a <a

is executed successfully, VCF Installer is done.VCF Installer is responsible for:\nValidating hardware readiness\nValidating network configuration\nValidating DNS / NTP / IPAM\nValidating credentials

That belongs to SDDC Manager.It is not:\nA lifecycle manager\nA long-running control plane\nA tenant or consumption interface\nA policy engine\nAn operations tool\nAfter bring-up:\nIt is not used

It’s the framework the mind uses to understand, predict, and decide—often without conscious awareness.It is a map, not the territory.In my view, a mental model is:\nA conceptual structure in the mind\nBuilt from experience, learning, and assumptions\nUsed to explain cause → effect and anticipate outcomes\nIt answers questions like:\n“If I do X, what will probably happen?”\n“Why did that fail?”\n“What matters here—and what doesn’t?”\nImagine driving in a foreign city.\nThe actual city is reality: complex, messy, and full of detail\nYour mental model is a rough subway map in your head\nThat map:\nOmits small streets\nDistorts distances\nFocuses only on what helps you get from A → B\nIt is useful precisely because it ignores detail—even if it’s inaccurate in places.That is what this (mostly) directed acyclic graph of documents (with occasional—intentional—loops) is trying to establish for <a data-href=\"VMware Cloud Foundation\"

overlapping mental models.For example, a database can be seen as:\nA storage engine\nA consistency system\nA failure domain\nA political boundary (ownership and control) Each model is incomplete on its own.\nTaken together, they are powerful.\nThis document intentionally favors some mental models over others—not because they are “more correct,” but because they are more useful for the problems

to run\nHow to configure the machine\nWhat software to install\nHow to secure and scale it\nAnalogy:\nOwning hardware → buying a house\nIaaS → renting an empty apartment (walls and plumbing are there; furniture and rules are up to you) Amazon Web Services → EC2\nMicrosoft Azure → Virtual Machines\nGoogle Cloud → Compute Engine\nAll of these give you VMs, networks, and storage—but no application

An input parameter is an argument that the workflow processes when it runs. The user, an application, another workflow, or an action passes input parameters to a workflow for the workflow to process when it runs.For example, if a workflow resets a virtual machine, the workflow requires the name of the virtual machine as an input parameter.A workflow's output parameters represent the result from the workflow run. Output parameters can change when a workflow or a workflow element runs. During a workflow run, the workflow can receive the output parameters of other workflows as input parameters.For example, if a workflow creates a snapshot of a virtual machine, the output parameter for the workflow is the resulting snapshot.Workflow elements process data that they receive as input parameters, and set the resulting data as workflow variables or output parameters.Read-only workflow variables act as global constants for a workflow. Writable variables act as a workflow’s global variables.You can use variables to transfer data between the elements of a workflow.You can obtain variables in the following ways:\nDefine variables when you create a workflow.\nSet the output parameter of a workflow element as a workflow variable.\nInherit variables from a configuration element.\nA workflow schema is a graphical representation that shows the workflow as a flow diagram of interconnected workflow elements. The workflow schema is the most important element of a workflow as it determines its logic.When users run a workflow, they provide the values for the input parameters of the workflow in the workflow presentation.A workflow token represents a workflow that is running or has finished running.A workflow is an abstract description of a process that defines a generic sequence of steps and a generic set of required input parameters. When you run a workflow with a set of input parameters, you receive an instance of this abstract workflow that behaves according to the specific input parameters you give it. This specific instance of a finished or a running workflow is called a workflow token.Workflow Token Attributes are the specific parameters with which a workflow token runs.The workflow token attributes are an aggregation of the workflow's global variables and the specific input and output parameters with which you run the workflow token.<br>Next, you might want to look into <a
